### 🔌 Plug-and-Play Setup (PowerShell)

Add this guidance as a git submodule and run the installer to auto-configure lightweight compliance hooks (non-invasive by default).

1) Add the submodule (HTTPS)

```powershell
git submodule add https://github.com/Nubimancy/bc-copilot-guidance copilot-guidance
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2) Run the installer

- From the project root:

```powershell
pwsh -File ./copilot-guidance/scripts/install-bc-copilot-guidance.ps1
```

- Or from inside the submodule (auto-detects project root):

```powershell
cd ./copilot-guidance
pwsh -File ./scripts/install-bc-copilot-guidance.ps1
```

Optional flags
- Preview only:

```powershell
pwsh -File ./copilot-guidance/scripts/install-bc-copilot-guidance.ps1 -DryRun
```

- Enable PR gate and annotate AL files:

```powershell
pwsh -File ./copilot-guidance/scripts/install-bc-copilot-guidance.ps1 -EnableCI -AnnotateAL
```

To update later

```powershell
git submodule update --remote --merge copilot-guidance
```

# AL Code Style Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for AL code in this project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code.

## Variable Naming Conventions

1. **PascalCase for Object Names**: Use PascalCase for all object names (tables, pages, codeunits, etc.)
   ```al
   codeunit 50100 "Sales Order Processor"
   ```

2. **PascalCase for Variable Names**: Use PascalCase for all variable names
   ```al
   var
       Customer: Record Customer;
       SalesHeader: Record "Sales Header";
       TotalAmount: Decimal;
   ```

3. **Prefix Temporary Variables**: Use prefix 'Temp' for temporary records
   ```al
   var
       TempSalesLine: Record "Sales Line" temporary;
   ```

4. **Variable Declaration Order**: Variables should be ordered by type in the following sequence:
   - Record
   - Report
   - Codeunit
   - XmlPort
   - Page
   - Query
   - Notification
   - BigText
   - DateFormula
   - RecordId
   - RecordRef
   - FieldRef
   - FilterPageBuilder
   - Other types (Text, Integer, Decimal, etc.)

## Code Formatting and Indentation

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)

2. **Line Length**: Keep lines under 120 characters when possible

3. **Braces**: Place opening braces on the same line as the statement
   ```al
   if Customer.Find() then begin
       // Code here
   end;
   ```

4. **BEGIN..END Usage**: Only use BEGIN..END to enclose compound statements (multiple lines)
   ```al
   // Correct
   if Customer.Find() then
       Customer.Delete();

   // Also correct (for multiple statements)
   if Customer.Find() then begin
       Customer.CalcFields("Balance (LCY)");
       Customer.Delete();
   end;
   ```

5. **IF-ELSE Structure**: Each 'if' keyword should start a new line
   ```al
   if Condition1 then
       Statement1
   else if Condition2 then
       Statement2
   else
       Statement3;
   ```

6. **CASE Statement**: Use CASE instead of nested IF-THEN-ELSE when comparing the same variable against multiple values
   ```al
   // Instead of this:
   if Type = Type::Item then
       ProcessItem()
   else if Type = Type::Resource then
       ProcessResource()
   else
       ProcessOther();

   // Use this:
   case Type of
       Type::Item:
           ProcessItem();
       Type::Resource:
           ProcessResource();
       else
           ProcessOther();
   end;
   ```

## Object Property Qualification

1. **Use "this" Qualification**: Always use "this" to qualify object properties when accessing them from within the same object
   ```al
   // In a table or page method
   procedure SetStatus(NewStatus: Enum "Status")
   begin
       this.Status := NewStatus;
       this.Modify();
   end;
   ```

2. **Explicit Record References**: Always use explicit record references when accessing fields
   ```al
   // Correct
   Customer.Name := 'CRONUS';

   // Incorrect
   Name := 'CRONUS';
   ```

## String Formatting

1. **Text Constants for String Formatting**: Use text constants for string formatting instead of hardcoded strings
   ```al
   // Define at the top of the object
   var
       CustomerCreatedMsg: Label 'Customer %1 has been created.';

   // Use in code
   Message(CustomerCreatedMsg, Customer."No.");
   ```

2. **String Concatenation**: Use string formatting instead of concatenation
   ```al
   // Instead of this:
   Message('Customer ' + Customer."No." + ' has been created.');

   // Use this:
   Message(CustomerCreatedMsg, Customer."No.");
   ```

3. **Placeholders**: Use numbered placeholders (%1, %2, etc.) in labels
   ```al
   ErrorMsg: Label 'Cannot delete %1 %2 because it has %3 entries.';
   ```

## Error Handling

1. **Descriptive Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
   ```al
   if not Customer.Find() then
       Error(CustomerNotFoundErr, CustomerNo);
   ```

2. **Error Constants**: Define error messages as constants
   ```al
   CustomerNotFoundErr: Label 'Customer %1 does not exist.';
   ```

## Comments

1. **Procedure Comments**: Document the purpose of procedures, parameters, and return values
   ```al
   /// <summary>
   /// Calculates the total amount for a sales document.
   /// </summary>
   /// <param name="DocumentType">The type of the sales document.</param>
   /// <param name="DocumentNo">The number of the sales document.</param>
   /// <returns>The total amount of the sales document.</returns>
   procedure CalculateTotalAmount(DocumentType: Enum "Sales Document Type"; DocumentNo: Code[20]): Decimal
   ```

2. **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or business rules

## Removing Unused Variables

1. **Remove Unused Variables**: Delete variables that are declared but not used in the code
   ```al
   // If TempRecord is never used, remove it
   var
       Customer: Record Customer;
       // TempRecord: Record "Temp Record";  // Unused - should be removed
   ```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Use FindSet() with Repeat-Until**: For looping through records
   ```al
   if SalesLine.FindSet() then
       repeat
           // Process each record
       until SalesLine.Next() = 0;
   ```

2. **Use SetRange/SetFilter Before Find**: Limit record sets before processing
   ```al
   Customer.SetRange("Country/Region Code", 'US');
   if Customer.FindSet() then
   ```

By following these guidelines, you'll create more maintainable, readable, and efficient AL code.

# Performance Optimization Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for optimizing AL code performance in Business Central.

## Database Operations

### Minimize Database Operations Through Efficient Filtering

- Use appropriate filters before reading records
- Use SetLoadFields() to load only needed fields
- Use SetRange/SetFilter with indexed fields when possible
- Avoid using FIND('-') without filters

### Avoid Nested Database Loops

- Never put database calls inside loops if possible
- Use temporary tables to store intermediate results
- Consider using queries for complex data retrieval
- Use bulk operations instead of record-by-record processing

### Use TempTables for Intermediate Data

- Declare record variables as temporary for in-memory operations
- Process data in memory before writing to database
- Use temporary tables for sorting and filtering operations

### Implement Proper Transaction Handling

- Keep transactions as short as possible
- Avoid user interaction during transactions
- Use LockTable() only when necessary and as late as possible
- Consider using snapshot isolation for read operations

## UI Performance

### Minimize Code in OnAfterGetRecord Triggers

- Move complex calculations to separate procedures
- Use CurrPage.UPDATE(FALSE) to avoid unnecessary refreshes
- Consider using background tasks for heavy calculations

### Use FlowFields and FlowFilters Appropriately

- Avoid excessive CALCFIELDS calls, especially in loops
- Use SetAutoCalcFields only for fields that are always needed
- Consider using normal fields with manual updates for frequently accessed calculated values

### Optimize UI Performance

- Use DisableControls/EnableControls when updating multiple records
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Minimize the number of visible fields on list pages
- Use page extensions instead of replacing entire pages

## Background Processing

# Naming Conventions

This document outlines the naming conventions for variables, parameters, and objects in Business Central AL code.

## General Naming Guidelines

- Use PascalCase for all identifiers (objects, variables, parameters, methods)
- Create descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood
- Be consistent with naming patterns throughout the codebase
- Follow Microsoft's official AL naming guidelines

## Variables and Parameters

### Record Variables

- Names of variables and parameters of type `Record` should be suffixed with the table name without whitespaces
- For multiple variables of the same record type, use meaningful suffixes

**Wrong:**
```al
JobRecordJob: Record Job;
```

**Right:**
```al
Job: Record Job;
```

### Page Variables

- Names of variables and parameters of type `Page` should be suffixed with the page name without whitespaces

**Wrong:**
```al
JobPage: Page Job;
```

**Right:**
```al
JobPage: Page Job;
```

### Multiple Variables of Same Type

- If there is a need for multiple variables or parameters of the same type, the name must be suffixed with a meaningful name

**Example:**
```al
CustomerNew: Record Customer;
CustomerOld: Record Customer;
```

### Parameter Declaration

- A parameter must only be declared as `var` if necessary (when the parameter needs to be modified)

### Variable Ordering

- Object and complex variable types must be listed first, and then simple variables
- The order is: Record, Report, Codeunit, XmlPort, Page, Query, Notification, BigText, DateFormula, RecordId, RecordRef, FieldRef, and FilterPageBuilder
- The rest of the variables are not sorted

## Object Naming

### Tables and Fields

- Table names should be singular nouns
- Field names should clearly describe the data they contain
- Boolean fields should be named with a positive assertion (e.g., "Is Complete" not "Not Complete")

### Pages

- List pages should be named with the plural form of the entity
- Card pages should be named with "Card" suffix
- Document pages should be named with the document type

### Codeunits

- Codeunits implementing business logic should be named after the functionality they provide
- Utility codeunits should have a suffix indicating their purpose (e.g., "Mgt" for management)
- Event subscriber codeunits should have "Event Subscribers" in their name

### Reports

- Report names should clearly indicate their purpose and output
- Processing reports should include "Processing" in their name

## Prefix Guidelines

1. All objects must have a prefix
2. The prefix is defined in the AppSourceCop.json file
3. The prefix is always in this format '<Prefix> ' where <Prefix> is the prefix defined in the AppSourceCop.json file
4. The prefix is always in uppercase
5. The prefix is always followed by a space
6. The prefix is always just once in the object name
7. The prefix is always in the beginning of the object name

## Quick Reference

### Essential AL Development Rules
- **Follow Extension Model**: Never modify base application, use table/page extensions
- **Use Proper Naming**: Follow PascalCase, meaningful names, consistent terminology
- **Implement Error Handling**: Actionable error messages with user guidance
- **Optimize Performance**: Use SetLoadFields, avoid nested loops, proper filtering
- **Maintain Code Quality**: Always check for linter errors, follow style guidelines

### Common Development Patterns

{
    fields
    {
        field(1; "Entry No."; Integer) { }
        field(2; Description; Text[100]) { }
    }
}

// Performance-optimized record access
Customer.SetLoadFields("No.", Name, "E-Mail");
if Customer.FindSet() then
    repeat
        // Process each record
    until Customer.Next() = 0;
```

## Search Keywords

### AL Language Keywords

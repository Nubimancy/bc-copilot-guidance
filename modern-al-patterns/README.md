## Purpose

Modern AL development goes beyond basic functionality. This section provides patterns for:
- **Better code architecture** following proven principles
- **Extensible solutions** that can grow and adapt
- **Maintainable codebases** that scale with teams
- **Testable implementations** that ensure quality
- **Event-driven designs** that enable customization

## AI-Enhanced Development

These patterns are designed to help GitHub Copilot understand and suggest better architectural decisions in your AL code.

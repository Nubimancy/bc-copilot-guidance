## Progress Summary
- **Latest Completed**: areas/security/bc-entra-id-integration.md (Security Area COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Next Priority**: Background Tasks Area Files (Priority 3)
- **Current Working**: areas/background-tasks/bc-multi-tenant-job-coordination.md
- **Validation Status**: Not yet run

## Successful BC-Specific Approach
Developed effective remediation method that:
1. âœ… Removes AL code blocks (as required by validation)
2. âœ… Maintains BC-specific context and relevance  
3. âœ… Provides practical BC implementation guidance
4. âœ… Keeps atomic topic focus on actual BC development patterns

Key success factors:
- Focus on BC objects (ErrorInfo, Telemetry codeunit, etc.)
- Preserve BC concepts (DataClassification, TelemetryScope, etc.) 
- Include BC integration patterns (Application Insights, multi-tenant)
- Maintain BC operational context (Company, User, Session)

## Time Tracking
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-21 (initial assessment)
- **Approach Revision**: 2025-08-21 ~1:15 PM (discovered BC relevance issue)
- **New Method Success**: 2025-08-21 ~1:25 PM (first file successfully converted with BC relevance)
- **Average Time Per File**: ~4 minutes (with new BC-focused method)
- **Estimated Completion**: 2025-08-21 ~4:41 PM (84 files Ã— 4 min = 336 min = 5.6 hours remaining)

## Next Steps
1. Start with Priority 1 files (most recent)
2. Work systematically through each priority group
3. Run validation scripts every 10 files
4. Update progress counters after each completion
5. **ðŸ”„ RESTART CONTEXT EVERY 10 FILES**: To optimize token usage and maintain performance, restart Claude Code context every 10 completed files. Simply provide instruction: "Continue REMEDIATION.md systematic file conversion using established BC-specific approach"

## Validation Commands to Run Regularly
```powershell
# Validate frontmatter (must be 100% success)
.\tools\Validate-FrontMatter.ps1

# Validate type indexes (must be 0 errors)
.\tools\Validate-TypeIndexes.ps1

# Check for remaining AL code in main topics
Get-ChildItem -Path 'areas' -Recurse -Filter '*.md' | Where-Object { $_.Name -notmatch '-samples\.md$' } | ForEach-Object { $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw; if ($content -match '```(al|AL)') { $_.Name } }
```

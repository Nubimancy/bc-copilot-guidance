## Quick Reference

### 🎯 **Good AI Prompts for BC**
```
"Review this AL code against bc-copilot-guidance patterns"
"Refactor using SOLID principles from modern-al-patterns"  
"Add proper error handling with ErrorInfo patterns"
"Create upgrade procedure following lifecycle management guide"
```

### 🚫 **Prompts to Avoid**
```
"Write code for me" (too vague)
"Fix this" (no context)
"Make it better" (unclear goals)
"Is this right?" (without specific criteria)
```

### 🏆 **Success Patterns**
- **Start small** - Begin with low-risk AI assistance
- **Be specific** - Include context and requirements in prompts
- **Validate always** - Check AI suggestions against BC best practices
- **Learn iteratively** - Build expertise through guided practice

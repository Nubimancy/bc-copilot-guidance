## Specialized Review Prompts

### Error Handling Focus
```
"Review the error handling in this AL code using patterns from bc-copilot-guidance/modern-al-patterns/modern-error-handling.md. Check for:
- ErrorInfo usage instead of generic Error() calls
- Suggested actions for user recovery
- Proper error context and messaging
- Telemetry integration"

[Paste your AL code here]
```

### Performance Review
```
"Analyze this AL code for performance issues, especially:
- Database query efficiency 
- Loop optimizations
- Memory usage patterns
- Transaction scope management

Reference performance patterns from bc-copilot-guidance/core-development/performance-optimization.md"

[Paste your AL code here]
```

### Security Review
```
"Review this AL code for security considerations:
- Data access permissions
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention  
- Sensitive data handling

Cross-reference with security patterns from bc-copilot-guidance"

[Paste your AL code here]
```

### Upgrade Safety Review
```
"Check this code for upgrade and AppSource compliance using bc-copilot-guidance/modern-al-patterns/upgrade-lifecycle-management.md:
- Proper use of obsolete attributes
- Data migration safety
- Breaking change considerations
- Extension compatibility"

[Paste your AL code here]
```

## Context Enhancement Tips

### üéØ **Make Prompts More Effective**
- **Include business context:** "This is for customer invoice processing..."
- **Specify quality level:** "This needs to be production-ready for AppSource..."
- **Set scope boundaries:** "Focus on just the validation logic..."
- **Reference expertise:** "I'm experienced with AL but new to these patterns..."

### üîÑ **Iterative Review Pattern**
1. **First pass:** "Quick review for obvious issues"
2. **Second pass:** "Deeper analysis of specific concerns"
3. **Final pass:** "Overall architecture and maintainability"

### üõ°Ô∏è **Always Include**
```
"If you suggest changes, explain why each change improves the code and reference specific guidance from bc-copilot-guidance where applicable."
```

# AI-Assisted Development Workflow üîÑ

**Daily development patterns that integrate AI assistance effectively into BC development**

## The Adaptive Workflow Framework

### Step 1: Assessment & Context Setting
```
Before starting any development task:

"Hi! I'm working on [specific BC development task]. 

My experience level:
- AL Development: [beginner/intermediate/expert]  
- AI-Assisted Coding: [new/learning/comfortable/advanced]

Can you help me approach this using guidance from bc-copilot-guidance?"
```

### Step 2: Planning with AI
Based on your experience level, use appropriate planning prompts:

#### üå± **For Beginners (AL or AI)**
```
"I need to [specific task like 'create a customer validation codeunit']. 

Can you:
1. Break this down into simple steps
2. Show me which sections of bc-copilot-guidance will help
3. Give me a safe starting point
4. Explain what I should learn from each step"
```

#### üîß **For Intermediate Users** 
```
"I'm designing [specific feature]. Help me:
1. Choose appropriate patterns from bc-copilot-guidance
2. Identify potential challenges early
3. Plan the development sequence  
4. Set up validation checkpoints"
```

#### üèóÔ∏è **For Advanced Users**
```
"Architecture review for [complex feature]:
1. Analyze approach against bc-copilot-guidance patterns
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Plan for extensibility and upgrades
4. Consider team development workflow"
```

## Daily Development Cycle

### üåÖ **Morning Planning (5-10 minutes)**
```
AI Prompt: "Review my planned tasks for today:
[List your planned development work]

Help me prioritize and identify which bc-copilot-guidance sections I should reference. Flag any tasks that might need special attention."
```

### üîÑ **Development Loop (Repeated throughout day)**

#### 1. **Before Writing Code**
```
"I'm about to implement [specific functionality]. 

Reference relevant patterns from bc-copilot-guidance and help me:
- Choose the right approach
- Identify potential pitfalls  
- Plan error handling strategy
- Consider testing approach"
```

#### 2. **During Code Writing**  
```
"Review this partial implementation against bc-copilot-guidance patterns:
[Paste code in progress]

Is this on the right track? Any course corrections needed?"
```

#### 3. **After Code Section Complete**
```
"Code review for this completed section:
[Paste completed code]

Check against bc-copilot-guidance for:
- Pattern compliance
- Missing error handling
- Performance considerations  
- Improvement opportunities"
```

### üåô **End-of-Day Review (10-15 minutes)**
```
"Daily reflection on code quality:

Today I implemented: [Summary of work]
Code sections to review: [Specific areas of concern]

Using bc-copilot-guidance standards:
1. What did I do well today?
2. What patterns should I study for tomorrow?
3. Any technical debt to address?
4. Learning goals for next session?"
```

## Task-Specific Workflows

### üÜï **New Feature Development**

#### Phase 1: Analysis
```
"Feature analysis for: [Feature description]

1. Which bc-copilot-guidance patterns apply
2. Required BC objects and relationships
3. Integration points and dependencies
4. Testing strategy outline"
```

#### Phase 2: Design
```
"Design review for [feature]:
[Paste design/pseudocode]

Validate against bc-copilot-guidance:
- Architecture patterns
- Data access approach
- Error handling strategy  
- Extension points"
```

#### Phase 3: Implementation
```
"Implementation checkpoint:
[Paste current code]

Progress check against bc-copilot-guidance:
- Following planned patterns?
- Missing any critical elements?
- Ready for testing phase?"
```

#### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
```
"Pre-deployment review:
[Paste completed code]

Final validation using bc-copilot-guidance:
- Production readiness
- Performance verification
- Security considerations
- Documentation completeness"
```

### üêõ **Bug Fix Workflow**

#### 1. **Problem Analysis**
```
"Bug analysis for: [Bug description]

Help me:
1. Identify likely root causes using bc-copilot-guidance patterns
2. Plan investigation approach
3. Consider related issues that might exist
4. Estimate fix complexity"
```

#### 2. **Solution Design**
```
"Fix strategy for [bug]:
[Describe proposed fix]

Validate against bc-copilot-guidance:
- Will this address root cause?
- Are there better pattern-based approaches?
- What testing is needed?
- Risk of introducing new issues?"
```

#### 3. **Implementation Review**
```
"Bug fix implementation:
[Paste fix code]

Review using bc-copilot-guidance for:
- Pattern compliance
- Comprehensive solution
- Prevention of similar issues
- Testing adequacy"
```

### üîß **Refactoring Workflow**

#### 1. **Refactoring Assessment**
```
"Refactoring analysis:
[Paste code to refactor]

Using bc-copilot-guidance anti-patterns and modern patterns:
1. What issues does this code have?
2. Which patterns should I apply?
3. What's the safest refactoring sequence?
4. How to maintain functionality during refactoring?"
```

#### 2. **Step-by-Step Refactoring**
```
"Refactoring checkpoint:
Original: [Original code section]
Refactored: [New code section]

Progress check:
- Following intended patterns?
- Maintaining all functionality?
- Ready for next refactoring step?"
```

## Human-AI Collaboration Best Practices

### üéØ **Effective Prompting Strategies**

#### **Context-Rich Prompts**
```
‚úÖ Good: "I'm implementing customer credit validation for a multi-tenant SaaS app. This needs to handle high volume and integrate with external credit services. Review against bc-copilot-guidance patterns."

‚ùå Poor: "Review this code."
```

#### **Specific Guidance Reference**
```
‚úÖ Good: "Check this against the SOLID principles in bc-copilot-guidance/modern-al-patterns/solid-principles.md, especially dependency inversion."

‚ùå Poor: "Make this code better."
```

#### **Clear Success Criteria**
```
‚úÖ Good: "This code needs to be AppSource-ready, handle 1000+ concurrent users, and follow upgrade-safe patterns from bc-copilot-guidance."

‚ùå Poor: "Is this good enough?"
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Validation Framework**

#### **Always Verify AI Suggestions**
1. **Pattern Compliance:** Does suggestion align with bc-copilot-guidance?
2. **BC Context:** Is the AI aware of BC-specific constraints?
3. **Business Logic:** Does the solution make sense for your use case?
4. **Testing:** Can you validate the suggested approach?

#### **Red Flags in AI Responses**
- Generic code without BC context
- Suggestions that contradict bc-copilot-guidance
- Complex solutions without justification
- Missing error handling or validation
- Outdated AL patterns

### üìà **Confidence Building Process**

#### **Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Start with simple, low-risk prompts
- Focus on code review and validation
- Use AI to explain existing patterns
- Build trust through small successes

#### **Week 3-4: Active Assistance**  
- Use AI for planning and design feedback
- Request alternative approaches
- Get help with complex debugging
- Practice iterative development

#### **Week 5+: Advanced Collaboration**
- Complex architectural discussions
- Advanced pattern application
- Team workflow integration
- Mentoring others in AI-assisted development

## Team Integration Patterns

### ü§ù **Code Review Enhancement**
```
"Team code review for: [Feature/Bug fix]
[Paste code]

Analyze using bc-copilot-guidance standards for:
- Team consistency with our established patterns
- Knowledge sharing opportunities  
- Mentoring points for junior developers
- Process improvement suggestions"
```

### üìö **Knowledge Sharing**
```
"Create learning summary for the team:

Today's development work: [Summary]
Patterns applied: [List from bc-copilot-guidance]
Lessons learned: [Key insights]
Team knowledge gaps identified: [Areas to focus]

Format as brief team share for tomorrow's standup."
```

   - Are there opportunities to apply better patterns?

3. **Quality Indicators**
   - Is the code readable and self-documenting?
   - Are complex sections adequately commented?
   - Is the code structure logical and maintainable?

### **Phase 2: Detailed Review** üîç
In-depth code analysis:

1. **Functionality Review**
   - Does the code accomplish its intended purpose effectively?
   - Are edge cases and error conditions handled appropriately?
   - Is business logic implemented clearly and correctly?

2. **Security & Performance**
   - Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
   - Could performance be impacted by current implementation choices?
   - Are resources managed efficiently?

3. **Maintainability Assessment**
   - Will future developers be able to understand this code easily?
   - Is the code flexible enough to accommodate likely future changes?
   - Are dependencies managed appropriately?

### **Phase 3: Improvement Recommendations** ‚ö°

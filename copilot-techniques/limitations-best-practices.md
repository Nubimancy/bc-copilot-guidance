# Copilot Limitations and Best Practices - AI Self-Awareness Framework

<!-- AI_TRIGGER: When Copilot suggests AL code, proactively warn about common limitations and suggest validation -->
<!-- COPILOT_GUIDANCE: This guide teaches Copilot self-awareness about limitations and proactive validation strategies -->

## How to Use This Guide with Copilot

<!-- AI_INSTRUCTION: When providing AL development assistance, proactively:
1. Acknowledge potential limitations in suggestions
2. Recommend validation steps for generated code
3. Suggest DevOps integration for code verification
4. Provide alternative approaches when uncertain
-->

### Self-Awareness Prompting for Copilot

<!-- PROMPT_EDUCATION: 
WEAK: "Generate AL code"
BETTER: "Generate AL code with validation steps, acknowledging any limitations, and suggest verification against Business Central documentation and DevOps quality gates"
EDUCATIONAL_NOTE: "Enhanced prompts request validation steps (verification), include self-awareness (limitations), reference standards (BC documentation), and consider workflow integration (DevOps quality gates). This yields more reliable and verifiable results."
-->

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<!-- AI_TRIGGER: When suggesting AL code, proactively warn about these common pitfalls and suggest validation -->
<!-- PROACTIVE_SUGGEST: During code generation -> Suggest validation steps and documentation verification -->

### ‚ùå Hallucinated APIs and Syntax

**Problem:** Copilot may suggest non-existent AL procedures or outdated syntax
- Suggests fictional Business Central APIs that don't exist
- Recommends deprecated procedures or obsolete patterns
- Creates plausible-looking but incorrect method signatures

<!-- COPILOT_GUIDANCE: When discussing API validation, remind developers to:
1. Add API validation to DevOps testing pipeline
2. Update work items with API verification status
3. Document API validation in code review checklists
4. Consider automated API validation tools
-->

**Solution:**
- Always verify against official Business Central documentation
- Cross-reference with established patterns in CoreDevelopment/
- Test generated code in actual Business Central environment
- Use IntelliSense to validate suggested procedures

**Example Validation:**
```al
// ‚ùå Copilot might suggest (fictional):
Customer.CalculateRewardPoints(Amount, TierLevel);

// ‚úÖ Verify actual API exists:
if Customer.FindFirst() then
    // Check if CalculateRewardPoints actually exists
```

### ‚ùå Inconsistent Naming

**Problem:** May not follow your specific naming conventions
- Uses generic naming patterns instead of organization standards
- Doesn't consider prefix requirements or object numbering
- Mixes different naming styles within the same codebase

**Solution:**
- Always reference SharedGuidelines/Standards/naming-conventions.md in prompts
- Include specific prefix requirements in context
- Provide examples of correct naming in your prompts

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
‚ùå Generic: "Create a customer table"
‚úÖ Specific: "Create a customer rewards table following our naming conventions in SharedGuidelines/Standards/naming-conventions.md, using prefix 'BRC' and object number range 50100-50199"
```

### ‚ùå Missing Error Handling

**Problem:** Generated code often lacks proper error handling
- Happy path implementations without exception handling
- Missing user-friendly error messages
- No validation of input parameters

**Solution:**
- Explicitly request error handling patterns from SharedGuidelines/Standards/error-handling.md
- Include error scenarios in your requirements
- Ask for validation logic to be included

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```
"Create a posting routine that includes proper error handling per SharedGuidelines/Standards/error-handling.md, with user-friendly messages for common failure scenarios"
```

### ‚ùå Outdated Patterns

**Problem:** May suggest deprecated AL patterns or procedures
- Uses obsolete object types or properties
- Suggests patterns that don't work in current BC versions
- Recommends discontinued development approaches

**Solution:**
- Cross-reference with current Business Central version documentation
- Specify target BC version in prompts
- Validate against Microsoft's latest development guidelines

**Version-Specific Prompting:**
```
"Create a Business Central extension for version 23.0 using current AL patterns, avoiding any deprecated approaches"
```

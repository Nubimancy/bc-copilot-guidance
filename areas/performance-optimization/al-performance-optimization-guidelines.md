# AL Performance Optimization Guidelines

## Overview

Performance optimization in AL development ensures responsive user experiences and efficient system resource utilization. This pattern establishes best practices for database operations, UI performance, and background processing in Business Central extensions.

## Core Performance Patterns

### Database Operation Optimization
- Efficient filtering and record retrieval strategies
- SetLoadFields usage for selective field loading
- Transaction management and locking strategies
- Bulk operation patterns over individual record processing

### UI Performance Enhancement
- OnAfterGetRecord trigger optimization
- FlowField and FlowFilter usage patterns
- Page rendering and refresh optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Background Processing
- StartSession for non-interactive processing
- Job queue entry implementation
- Progress reporting for long-running operations
- Asynchronous processing patterns

## AI Context Recognition Patterns

```markdown
<!-- CONTEXT_RECOGNITION_PATTERNS:
IF developer_working_with_records AND no_setloadfields_mentioned:
  SUGGEST: "Consider using SetLoadFields to load only necessary fields"
  EDUCATE: "SetLoadFields improves performance by loading only the fields you need"

IF developer_using_database_loops AND nested_operations_detected:
  SUGGEST: "Avoid nested database operations in loops"
  EDUCATE: "Use temporary tables or queries to minimize database round trips"
-->
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Progressive Performance Optimization
1. **Basic**: Apply fundamental database and UI optimization patterns
2. **Intermediate**: Implement advanced filtering and caching strategies
3. **Advanced**: Use background processing and asynchronous patterns
4. **Expert**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics

### Database Performance Patterns
- Use indexed fields for filtering and sorting
- Implement proper SetRange/SetFilter patterns
- Utilize temporary tables for intermediate processing
- Apply transaction optimization techniques

### UI Performance Strategies
- Minimize calculations in OnAfterGetRecord
- Optimize page update patterns
- Implement efficient data loading strategies
- Use appropriate control types for data presentation

## Best Practices

### Database Operations
- Always filter records before processing large datasets
- Use SetLoadFields() to load only required fields
- Avoid FIND('-') without filters on large tables
- Keep transactions as short as possible
- Use temporary tables for in-memory operations

### UI Performance
- Move complex calculations out of trigger events
- Use CurrPage.UPDATE(FALSE) to prevent unnecessary refreshes
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Minimize visible fields on list pages

### Background Processing
- Use StartSession for CPU-intensive operations
- Implement job queue entries for scheduled tasks
- Provide progress reporting for long operations
- Handle errors gracefully in background processes

### Performance Optimization Checklist

- [ ] **Database Filtering**: Appropriate filters applied before record processing
- [ ] **SetLoadFields**: Used to load only necessary fields
- [ ] **Transaction Management**: Transactions kept short and efficient
- [ ] **UI Optimization**: Minimal code in UI trigger events
- [ ] **Background Processing**: Long operations moved to background tasks
- [ ] **Caching**: Frequently accessed data cached appropriately

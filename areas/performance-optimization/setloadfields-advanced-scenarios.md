# SetLoadFields Advanced Scenarios

## Overview
Advanced SetLoadFields scenarios involve complex data processing, calculated fields, multi-table operations, and sophisticated performance optimization strategies that go beyond basic field loading.

## Key Concepts

### Calculated Fields with SetLoadFields
When working with FlowFields and calculated fields, SetLoadFields optimization becomes more complex:
- **CalcSums Operations** - Only load fields needed for sum calculations
- **FlowField Dependencies** - Include fields referenced in CalcFormula
- **Related Table Optimization** - Optimize field loading across table relationships
- **Nested Calculations** - Handle calculations that depend on other calculations

### Multi-Table Analysis
Complex business scenarios often require data from multiple related tables:
- **Master-Detail Processing** - Optimize both header and line table field loading
- **Lookup Table Integration** - Efficient loading from reference tables
- **Cross-Table Calculations** - Minimize field loading across table joins
- **Hierarchical Data Processing** - Optimize parent-child table relationships

### Complex Filtering with Optimization
Advanced filtering scenarios require careful field loading strategy:
- **Dynamic Filter Building** - Load only fields used in dynamic filters
- **Range-Based Processing** - Optimize for date ranges and numeric ranges
- **Multi-Criteria Filtering** - Balance filter performance with field loading
- **Conditional Field Loading** - Load different fields based on processing conditions

## Best Practices

### Strategic Field Loading
- **Load Fields Just-in-Time** - Don't load fields until they're needed
- **Batch Similar Operations** - Group operations that need the same fields
- **Cache Frequently Used Data** - Store commonly accessed field values in variables
- **Minimize Table Switching** - Process one table completely before moving to related tables

### Calculated Field Optimization
- **Include Calculation Dependencies** - Load all fields referenced in FlowField formulas
- **Optimize CalcSums Calls** - Use SetLoadFields on both primary and related tables
- **Consider Calculation Cost** - Balance field loading against calculation complexity
- **Pre-calculate When Possible** - Store calculated results to avoid repeated calculations

### Performance Trade-offs
- **Memory vs. Database Calls** - Sometimes loading extra fields is better than multiple queries
- **Complexity vs. Performance** - Don't over-optimize at the expense of code clarity
- **Maintainability** - Ensure optimizations don't make code hard to maintain
- **Testing Requirements** - Complex optimizations need thorough performance testing

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Optimization
Creating overly complex field loading logic that's hard to understand and maintain.

### Under-Optimization
Not applying SetLoadFields to all parts of a complex operation, leaving performance bottlenecks.

### Dependency Mismanagement
Missing subtle field dependencies that cause errors in complex scenarios.

### Inconsistent Patterns
Using different optimization approaches for similar operations, creating maintenance confusion.

# Bulk Processing Patterns

## Overview
Bulk processing patterns handle large datasets efficiently by minimizing database operations, using temporary tables, and leveraging set-based operations instead of row-by-row processing.

## Key Concepts

### Bulk vs. Individual Processing
- **Individual**: Process one record at a time (N operations)
- **Bulk**: Process multiple records together (fewer operations)
- **Performance**: Exponential improvement with larger datasets
- **Memory**: Trade-off between memory usage and speed

### Core Techniques
- **Temporary Tables**: In-memory processing and staging
- **Batch Operations**: Group related operations together
- **Set-Based Logic**: Minimize database round trips
- **Staged Processing**: Break large operations into manageable chunks

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Temporary Tables for Processing
- Load data into temporary tables first
- Perform calculations and transformations in memory
- Batch database updates at the end
- Reduce database transaction overhead

### 2. Implement Batch Size Limits
- Define reasonable batch sizes (1000-5000 records)
- Break large operations into smaller chunks
- Monitor memory usage and performance
- Provide progress feedback for long operations

### 3. Optimize Temporary Table Usage
- Use appropriate temporary table types
- Index temporary tables for complex operations
- Clear temporary data after processing
- Consider memory vs. disk trade-offs

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Anti-Patterns:
- Processing all records in a single transaction
- Ignoring memory limitations with large datasets
- Complex calculations on every record individually
- Missing progress indicators for long operations

### ✅ Use These Patterns Instead:
- Chunked processing with progress tracking
- Temporary table staging for complex operations
- Efficient batch size management
- Clear separation of data loading and processing

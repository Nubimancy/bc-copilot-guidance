# Business Event Patterns

## Overview
Business events enable real-time communication between Business Central and external systems by publishing structured messages when significant business processes occur.

## Key Concepts

### Business Event Characteristics
- **Real-time Publishing**: Events published immediately when business processes occur
- **Structured Data**: JSON-formatted event payloads with business context
- **External Consumption**: Designed for consumption by external systems
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking event publishing

### Event Publishing Flow
- **Trigger**: Business process completion
- **Publisher**: Business Central event publisher
- **Transport**: HTTP/REST or message queue
- **Consumer**: External system event handler

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Rich Event Payloads
- Include sufficient business context
- Use consistent JSON structure
- Provide both summary and detail data
- Include timestamps and correlation IDs

### 2. Implement Reliable Publishing
- Handle publishing failures gracefully
- Consider retry logic for transient failures
- Log publishing attempts and results
- Provide fallback mechanisms

### 3. Optimize for External Consumers
- Use standard HTTP status codes
- Provide clear event type identification
- Include API versioning considerations
- Document event schemas

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Anti-Patterns:
- Publishing events with insufficient context
- Synchronous processing blocking business logic
- Missing error handling for publishing failures
- Inconsistent event payload structures

### ✅ Use These Patterns Instead:
- Rich, contextual event payloads
- Asynchronous event publishing
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Standardized event schemas and formats

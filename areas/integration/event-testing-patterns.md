# Event Testing Patterns

## Overview
Testing event-driven code requires specific strategies to validate both event publishing and subscription behavior. Proper testing ensures events work correctly and maintain business logic integrity.

## Key Concepts

### Event Testing Challenges
- **Indirect Execution**: Events execute through subscription rather than direct calls
- **Multiple Subscribers**: Multiple handlers for the same event
- **State Dependencies**: Event behavior depends on business state
- **External Dependencies**: Business events may involve external systems

### Testing Strategies
- **Publisher Testing**: Verify events are published correctly
- **Subscriber Testing**: Validate event handler behavior
- **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end event flows
- **Mock Testing**: Isolate event testing from dependencies

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Event Publishing
- Verify events fire at correct business moments
- Validate event parameters contain expected data
- Test event publishing under various business conditions
- Ensure events don't fire when business rules prevent them

### 2. Test Event Subscribers
- Create isolated tests for event handler logic
- Test subscriber behavior with various parameter combinations
- Validate subscriber error handling
- Test subscriber performance impact

### 3. Use Test Doubles for External Dependencies
- Mock external HTTP calls for business events
- Use test databases for integration testing
- Create stub subscribers for integration event testing
- Isolate unit tests from external system dependencies

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Anti-Patterns:
- Testing only the happy path scenarios
- Ignoring event subscription error handling
- Testing with production external systems
- Missing performance validation for event handlers

### ✅ Use These Patterns Instead:
- Comprehensive test coverage including error scenarios
- Robust error handling validation
- Proper test isolation with mocks and stubs
- Performance testing for event-heavy scenarios

# BC Data Upgrade Patterns

## Overview

Business Central data upgrade patterns focus on leveraging BC's built-in upgrade framework, upgrade codeunits, and data migration tools for seamless version transitions and data transformations. These patterns utilize BC's upgrade procedures, data upgrade table handling, and platform migration capabilities to ensure reliable and auditable data upgrades during BC version transitions.

## BC Upgrade Framework Architecture

### Upgrade Codeunit Patterns

**BC Platform Upgrade Integration**

Design upgrade codeunits that integrate with Business Central's upgrade framework:

- **Upgrade Codeunit Structure**: Use BC's upgrade codeunit template with proper upgrade tags and procedures
- **Data Upgrade Procedures**: Implement upgrade procedures that handle table structure changes and data transformations
- **Upgrade Tag Management**: Use BC's upgrade tag system to track completed upgrade procedures and prevent re-execution
- **Company-Specific Upgrades**: Design upgrade logic that works correctly across multiple companies in BC
- **Extension Upgrade Coordination**: Coordinate upgrades between base application and extension updates

### Data Transformation Management

**BC Data Upgrade Processing**

Handle data transformations during BC version upgrades using BC's upgrade framework:

- **Table Obsolescence Handling**: Manage obsolete table migration using BC's obsolete object lifecycle
- **Field Mapping and Transformation**: Transform data when field structures change between BC versions
- **Data Type Conversions**: Handle data type changes using BC's field mapping and conversion capabilities
- **Record Validation**: Validate migrated data against BC's standard validation rules and business logic
- **Temporary Table Usage**: Use temporary tables for complex data transformations during upgrade processes

## BC Configuration and Data Migration

### Data Migration Tools Integration

**BC Platform Migration Features**

Leverage Business Central's built-in data migration capabilities:

- **Configuration Packages**: Use BC's configuration packages for structured data migration and setup
- **RapidStart Services**: Implement RapidStart methodology for efficient BC implementation and data migration
- **Data Migration APIs**: Utilize BC's data migration APIs for programmatic data transfer and validation
- **Excel Import/Export**: Leverage BC's Excel integration for user-friendly data migration workflows
- **Data Template Integration**: Use BC data templates for consistent data structure and validation during migration

### BC Upgrade Validation Framework

**Platform-Specific Validation Patterns**

Implement validation using BC's built-in validation capabilities:

- **Data Consistency Checks**: Validate data consistency using BC's table validation and posting routines
- **Business Rule Validation**: Ensure migrated data complies with BC's business logic and posting validation
- **Number Series Validation**: Validate number series integrity and avoid conflicts during upgrade processes
- **Dimension Validation**: Ensure dimension data integrity and consistency across migrated records
- **Multi-Company Validation**: Validate upgrade procedures work correctly across all BC companies

## Implementation Checklist

### BC Upgrade Framework Setup
- [ ] **Upgrade Codeunit Creation**: Design upgrade codeunits using BC's upgrade codeunit template with proper structure
- [ ] **Upgrade Tag Implementation**: Implement upgrade tags to track completed procedures and prevent re-execution

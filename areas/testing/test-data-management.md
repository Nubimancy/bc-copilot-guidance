# Test Data Management

## Overview
Effective test data management is crucial for reliable, maintainable AL tests. This involves creating consistent, reusable test data that supports various testing scenarios without creating dependencies between tests.

## Key Concepts

### Scenario-Specific Test Data
Create test data tailored to specific testing scenarios:
- **Minimal Data** - Only the data needed for the specific test
- **Realistic Data** - Data that represents real business scenarios
- **Boundary Data** - Data at limits and edge cases
- **Invalid Data** - Data designed to trigger error conditions

### Test Data Isolation
Ensure each test has its own data to prevent test interference:
- **Unique Identifiers** - Use prefixes or suffixes to avoid conflicts
- **Independent Records** - Don't share data between tests
- **Clean State** - Each test starts with a known, clean state

### Helper Method Patterns
Organize test data creation using helper methods:
- **Factory Methods** - Create standard objects (CreateStandardCustomer)
- **Builder Pattern** - Fluent interfaces for complex objects
- **Template Methods** - Base objects that can be customized
- **Setup Methods** - Initialize test environment and dependencies

## Best Practices

### Use Descriptive Naming Conventions
Test data should be clearly identifiable:
```al
// Good: Clear purpose and unique identifier
Customer."No." := 'TEST-LOYALTY-TIER2-001';
Customer.Name := 'Test Customer for Loyalty Tier 2';

// Avoid: Generic or ambiguous naming
Customer."No." := 'CUST001';
Customer.Name := 'Test Customer';
```

### Create Minimal, Focused Data
Only create the data necessary for each specific test:
- Don't create complete customer records when you only need a customer number
- Use default values for fields that don't affect the test outcome
- Focus on the data that drives the business logic being tested

### Implement Consistent Helper Methods
Create reusable helper methods for common test data scenarios:
```al
local procedure CreateStandardCustomer(var Customer: Record Customer)
local procedure CreateTierTwoCustomer(var Customer: Record Customer)  
local procedure CreateBlockedCustomer(var Customer: Record Customer)
```

### Use Test Prefixes
Prefix test data with identifiable markers:
- **TEST-** for general test data
- **XTEST-** for specific scenario data
- **ZTEST-** for cleanup or temporary data

### Manage Test Data Lifecycle
- **Create** data at the start of each test
- **Use** data during test execution  
- **Clean up** data after test completion (if needed)

## Common Pitfalls

### Shared Test Data
Avoid sharing data between tests as it creates dependencies and makes tests fragile.

### Overly Complex Test Data
Don't create more complex test data than necessary; it makes tests harder to understand and maintain.

### Hardcoded Values Throughout Tests
Centralize test data creation in helper methods rather than duplicating setup code.

### Ignoring Data Relationships
Ensure related records (like Customer â†’ Sales Orders) maintain referential integrity in test data.

### Persistent Test Data
Avoid leaving test data in the system after tests complete; clean up or use isolated test environments.

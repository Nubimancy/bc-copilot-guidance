# Business Logic Testing Patterns

## Overview
Business logic testing goes beyond basic unit tests to validate complex business scenarios, ensuring that your AL code handles real-world business requirements correctly and completely.

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Scenario Testing Pattern
Test complex business scenarios with multiple dimensions and comprehensive coverage:

**Four Dimensions of Testing:**
1. **Positive Scenarios** - Valid business cases work as expected
2. **Boundary Conditions** - Edge cases and limits are handled correctly
3. **Error Scenarios** - Invalid inputs produce appropriate errors
4. **Integration Points** - Cross-system interactions function properly

### Positive Scenario Testing
Test that valid business scenarios work as expected with proper setup, execution, and verification.

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
Ensure your business logic testing covers:
- **Normal Operations** - Standard business flows
- **Business Rules** - Domain-specific validation logic
- **State Transitions** - Process flow validations
- **Calculations** - Mathematical and business calculations
- **Conditional Logic** - Branch coverage for all paths

## Best Practices

### Structure Tests with Arrange-Act-Assert
1. **Arrange** - Set up test conditions and data
2. **Act** - Execute the business logic being tested
3. **Assert** - Verify expected outcomes and side effects

### Test Business Value, Not Implementation
Focus on testing what the business logic should accomplish, not how it's implemented internally.

### Use Descriptive Test Names
Test method names should clearly describe the scenario being tested:
- `TestLoyaltyPointsCalculationForTierTwoCustomer()`
- `TestDiscountApplicationWithMultiplePromotions()`
- `TestInventoryReservationWhenStockIsLimited()`

### Isolate Dependencies
Use test doubles or mocks to isolate the business logic being tested from external dependencies.

## Common Pitfalls

### Testing Implementation Details
Avoid testing internal method calls or private variables; focus on business outcomes.

### Incomplete Scenario Coverage
Don't just test the happy path; include edge cases and error conditions.

### Complex Test Setup
Keep test setup simple and focused; use helper methods for complex data creation.

### Brittle Assertions
Make assertions specific to business requirements, not incidental implementation details.

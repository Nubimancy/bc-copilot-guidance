# Boundary Condition Testing

## Overview
Boundary condition testing focuses on edge cases, limits, and error scenarios that often reveal bugs in business logic. These tests ensure your AL code handles unusual but valid conditions and fails gracefully with invalid inputs.

## Key Concepts

### Boundary Value Analysis
Test values at the boundaries of acceptable input ranges:
- **Minimum Values** - Lowest acceptable input
- **Maximum Values** - Highest acceptable input  
- **Just Below/Above Limits** - Values that should trigger validation
- **Zero and Negative** - Special numeric cases
- **Empty and Null** - Missing data scenarios

### Error Scenario Testing
Validate that your business logic properly handles invalid conditions:
- **Invalid Data States** - Corrupt or inconsistent data
- **Business Rule Violations** - Logic that breaks domain rules
- **System Constraints** - Database and platform limitations
- **External Dependencies** - Third-party system failures

### Edge Case Categories
Common boundary conditions to test in AL:
- **Quantity Limits** - Maximum order quantities, inventory levels
- **Date Ranges** - Start/end dates, fiscal periods, expiration dates
- **Decimal Precision** - Currency calculations, percentage limits
- **Text Length** - Field size limits, description boundaries
- **Enumeration Values** - First/last enum values, undefined states

## Best Practices

### Test Both Sides of Boundaries
For each boundary, test:
1. **Valid boundary value** - Should succeed
2. **Invalid boundary value** - Should fail appropriately
3. **Values just inside boundary** - Should succeed
4. **Values just outside boundary** - Should fail appropriately

### Validate Error Messages
When testing error scenarios:
- Verify the correct error is raised
- Check that error messages are user-friendly
- Ensure error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

### Use Parameterized Tests
When testing multiple boundary values, use test parameters to avoid code duplication while maintaining clear test intent.

### Test State Transitions
Validate boundary conditions during state changes:
- Status transitions (Draft → Approved → Processed)
- Workflow state changes
- Document lifecycle boundaries

## Common Pitfalls

### Only Testing Happy Path
Don't focus exclusively on valid scenarios; boundary conditions often reveal the most critical bugs.

### Insufficient Error Validation
Testing that an error occurs isn't enough; validate that the RIGHT error occurs with appropriate messaging.

### Ignoring System Limits
Platform limits (field sizes, numeric ranges) should be tested even if they seem unlikely to be reached.

### Boundary Condition Coupling
Avoid tests where boundary conditions depend on each other; test boundaries independently when possible.

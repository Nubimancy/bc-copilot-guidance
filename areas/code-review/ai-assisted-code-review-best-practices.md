# AI-Assisted Code Review Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Combine AI Efficiency with Human Judgment
- **AI Strengths:** Pattern recognition, consistency checking, comprehensive analysis
- **Human Strengths:** Business context, creative solutions, architectural vision
- **Best Practice:** Use AI for detailed analysis, human expertise for strategic decisions

### Validation and Context
- Always validate AI suggestions against specific business requirements
- Consider team expertise and project constraints when applying recommendations
- Use iterative refinement to improve AI prompt effectiveness over time

## Effectiveness Guidelines

### Before Review
- Prepare comprehensive context about business requirements
- Specify quality expectations and constraints
- Identify specific areas of concern or focus
- Reference relevant guidance documentation

### During Review
- Use progressive prompts to build understanding gradually
- Ask for explanations and rationale behind suggestions
- Request specific references to established patterns and guidelines
- Clarify implementation approaches for complex recommendations

### After Review
- Validate suggestions against business requirements and team capabilities
- Prioritize improvements based on impact and feasibility
- Document patterns and approaches for future reference
- Share learnings with team to improve collective AI prompt effectiveness

## Quality Assurance

### Critical Validation Points
- **Business Logic:** Ensure AI suggestions align with business requirements
- **Performance Impact:** Validate performance implications of suggested changes
- **Security Considerations:** Review security implications of recommendations
- **Upgrade Safety:** Confirm changes don't compromise upgrade compatibility

### Documentation and Learning
- Document effective prompt patterns for team reuse
- Capture AI suggestions that proved particularly valuable
- Note AI limitations encountered and human intervention required
- Build team knowledge about effective AI collaboration techniques

## Remember
The best code reviews combine AI efficiency with human business judgment. Use AI prompts as powerful starting points, but always validate suggestions against your specific requirements and context! ðŸŽ¯

# AppSource Integration and Performance Standards

## API Integration Compliance

### Business Central API Usage
When integrating with Business Central APIs for AppSource extensions:

- **Use Standard APIs**: Leverage existing Business Central APIs where possible
- **Custom API Development**: Follow Microsoft's API development guidelines
- **Authentication Handling**: Implement proper OAuth 2.0 authentication patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement retry logic
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages for API failures

### External System Integration
For extensions that integrate with external systems:

- **Security Requirements**: Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Data Privacy**: Implement proper data classification and handling
- **Timeout Handling**: Configure appropriate timeout values for external calls
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide graceful degradation when external systems are unavailable

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Standards
AppSource extensions must meet specific performance criteria:

- **Page Load Time**: Initial page load under 3 seconds
- **Record Processing**: Bulk operations complete within reasonable timeframes
- **Search Functionality**: Search results return within 2 seconds
- **Report Generation**: Standard reports complete within 30 seconds

### Resource Optimization

#### Database Performance
- Use appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement SetLoadFields for large record processing
- Avoid unnecessary database round trips
- Use temporary tables for complex calculations

#### Memory Management
- Dispose of objects properly to prevent memory leaks
- Use streaming for large data processing
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

### Performance Testing Requirements
- **Load Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes
- **Stress Testing**: Verify behavior under high concurrent usage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement telemetry for performance tracking
- **Baseline Establishment**: Document expected performance characteristics

## Integration Architecture Standards

### Event-Driven Design
- Implement integration events for extensibility
- Use publisher/subscriber patterns for loose coupling
- Provide meaningful event parameters and context
- Document all published integration events

### Data Synchronization Patterns
- Implement proper change tracking mechanisms
- Use batch processing for large data synchronization
- Provide conflict resolution strategies
- Implement proper error recovery and retry logic

### Service Integration
- Use dependency injection patterns where appropriate
- Implement service interfaces for testability
- Provide configuration options for integration endpoints
- Use connection pooling for external service calls

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Telemetry Implementation
- Implement Application Insights integration for monitoring
- Track key performance metrics and user interactions
- Log important business events and errors
- Provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Error Reporting
- Implement comprehensive error logging
- Provide actionable error messages to users
- Include correlation IDs for tracking issues across systems
- Implement proper error categorization and severity levels

## Scalability Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Support
- Ensure extension works correctly in multi-tenant environments
- Implement proper tenant isolation
- Handle tenant-specific configurations appropriately
- Test scalability across multiple tenants

### Cloud Readiness
- Design for cloud-first deployment
- Implement proper resource management
- Use cloud-native patterns and services where appropriate
- Ensure compatibility with Business Central online limitations

# CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Business Central
## Overview
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes for Business Central extensions. This pattern provides comprehensive approaches for implementing robust CI/CD workflows that ensure quality and reliability.
## Key Concepts
### Pipeline Stages
- **Build Stage**: Automated compilation and artifact generation
- **Test Stage**: Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Quality Gates**: Automated quality validation and compliance checks
- **Deployment Stages**: Progressive deployment through environments (dev  test  production)
### Integration Points
CI/CD pipelines integrate with version control, project management tools, testing frameworks, and deployment environments.
## Best Practices
### Build Pipeline Configuration
**GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Use Microsoft AL-Go Actions for Business Central specific build tasks
- Implement proper artifact management and versioning
- Configure parallel jobs for faster build times
- Integrate with Business Central Docker containers for consistent builds
**Azure DevOps Pipelines**
- Leverage Azure DevOps Build templates for Business Central
- Implement proper variable management and secrets handling
- Use agent pools optimized for Business Central development
- Configure build retention and cleanup policies
### Automated Testing Integration
**Multi-Level Testing Strategy**
- Codeunit tests for business logic validation
- Integration tests for system interaction validation
- Performance tests for scalability verification
- User acceptance tests for business requirement validation
**Test Reporting and Analytics**
- Generate comprehensive test reports with coverage metrics
- Implement test trend analysis and quality tracking
- Create automated notifications for test failures
- Maintain test documentation and execution history
### Quality Gate Implementation
**Automated Quality Checks**
-  coverage thresholds (minimum 80%)
- Static  analysis for AL-specific rules
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance baseline validation
**Manual Approval Gates**
- Business stakeholder approval for production deployments
- Architecture review for significant changes
- Security review for sensitive modifications
- Performance impact assessment for high-risk changes
## Common Pitfalls
### Over-Complex Pipeline Configuration
- **Risk**: Creating overly complex pipelines that are difficult to maintain
- **Impact**: Reduced deployment reliability, increased maintenance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple patterns and evolve based on actual needs
### Insufficient Test Coverage in Pipelines
- **Risk**: Automated tests that don't catch real-world issues
- **Impact**: Quality issues reaching production despite pipeline validation
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy with realistic test data
### Environment Configuration Drift
- **Risk**: Differences between development, testing, and production environments
- **Impact**: Deployment failures, unexpected behavior in production
- **Mitigation**: Infrastructure as  and consistent environment management

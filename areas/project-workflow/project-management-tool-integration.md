# Project Management Tool Integration Patterns

## Overview

Effective development workflows require seamless integration between project management tools and development environments. This pattern provides comprehensive approaches for connecting GitHub, Azure DevOps, and other project management systems with Business Central development processes.

## Key Concepts

### Integration Strategies
- **Repository-Based Management**: Using Git-based workflows for feature tracking
- **Work Item Integration**: Connecting development tasks to project management items  
- **Con Preservation**: Maintaining project con throughout development lifecycle
- **Automated Linking**: Connecting commits, pull requests, and deployments to project items

### Tool-Specific Patterns
Different project management tools require specific integration approaches while maintaining consistent workflow principles.

## Best Practices

### GitHub Integration Patterns

**Repository-Based Feature Management**
- Create feature branches linked to specific issues or requirements
- Use commit message conventions to automatically link work to issues
- Implement pull request templates that include project con
- Utilize GitHub Actions for automated project management updates

**Issue Management Integration**
- Use GitHub CLI for programmatic issue creation and management
- Link issues to milestones for sprint and release planning
- Implement label-based workflow state management
- Close issues automatically when features are successfully deployed

**Con Gathering Strategy**
- Maintain issue templates that capture complete business con
- Link related issues for dependency management and con preservation
- Use project boards for visual workflow management and progress tracking
- Integrate with external tools through GitHub's API ecosystem

### Azure DevOps Integration Patterns

**Work Item Management**
- Connect development work directly to Azure DevOps work items
- Use work item queries to gather comprehensive project con
- Implement work item templates for consistent information capture
- Track work item relationships and dependencies systematically

**Repository Integration Strategy**
- Link commits automatically to relevant work items
- Reference work items in pull requests for traceability
- Track deployment status through work item connections
- Monitor build and test results in con of project work

**Project Detection and Con**
- Implement consistent project naming conventions for automated detection
- Use project settings to maintain development environment consistency
- Gather complete work item con including relationships and history
- Preserve project con across different development phases

## Common Pitfalls

### Inconsistent Integration Patterns
- **Risk**: Different team members using different integration approaches
- **Impact**: Lost con, inconsistent project tracking, reduced visibility
- **Mitigation**: Establish and enforce consistent integration standards across team

### Con Loss During Tool Transitions
- **Risk**: Losing important project con when moving between tools
- **Impact**: Misaligned development work, duplicated effort, missed requirements
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive con preservation strategies

### Over-Engineering Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Creating overly complex integration patterns that are difficult to maintain
- **Impact**: Reduced development velocity, tool maintenance burden, team resistance
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple patterns and evolve based on actual needs

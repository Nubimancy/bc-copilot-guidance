# AI-Enhanced Development Principles

## Core Development Principles

When developing for Business Central with AI assistance, always follow these enhanced core principles:

### 1. Clean, Maintainable Code
- Write code that follows AL best practices
- Use AI to suggest improvements and refactoring opportunities
- Leverage AI for consistent code style enforcement

### 2. Performance-First Approach
- Optimize for operations that handle large datasets
- Use AI to identify performance bottlenecks proactively
- Implement AI-suggested caching and optimization patterns

### 3. Extension Model Adherence
- Follow the extension model rather than modifying base application
- Use AI to validate extension patterns and suggest alternatives
- Leverage AI for upgrade-safe code patterns

### 4. Intelligent Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful, actionable messages
- Use AI to generate user-friendly error messages
- Leverage AI for error pattern recognition and prevention

### 5. Consistent Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions and coding style
- Apply AI-assisted code formatting and standard enforcement
- Implement AI-driven quality gates for consistency validation

### 6. Seamless UX Integration
- Ensure extensions integrate seamlessly with Business Central UX
- Use AI to validate user experience patterns
- Leverage AI for accessibility and usability suggestions

### 7. AppSource Readiness
- Follow Microsoft's requirements for AppSource publication
- Use AI for compliance validation and requirement checking
- Implement AI-driven quality assurance for marketplace standards

## AI Integration Patterns

### Context Recognition
- AI should recognize development context and suggest relevant principles
- Provide principle-based validation throughout development process
- Offer educational guidance when principles are not followed

### Proactive Suggestions
- AI should suggest principle adherence during code creation
- Provide real-time feedback on principle violations
- Offer alternative approaches that align with core principles

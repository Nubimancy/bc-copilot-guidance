# AL Table Creation Patterns

## Overview

Table creation forms the foundation of AL development in Business Central. This pattern establishes best practices for creating tables with proper field validation, data integrity, and business logic integration.

## Core Table Patterns

### Field Definition Standards
- Use appropriate data types and field lengths
- Implement proper captions and tooltips
- Set data classification for privacy compliance
- Define table relations for referential integrity

### Validation Implementation
- Add field validation triggers for business rules
- Implement proper error handling with actionable messages
- Use NotBlank property for required fields
- Apply MinValue/MaxValue constraints where appropriate

### Business Logic Integration
- Separate validation logic into reusable procedures
- Implement proper transaction handling
- Use flowfields for calculated values
- Apply proper indexing strategies for performance

## AI Context Recognition Patterns

```markdown
<!-- CONTEXT_RECOGNITION_PATTERNS:
IF developer_creating_table AND no_validation_mentioned:
  SUGGEST: "Add field validation to ensure data integrity"
  EDUCATE: "Field validation prevents invalid data entry and maintains business rule compliance"

IF table_creation_without_dataclassification:
  SUGGEST: "Add DataClassification to all fields for privacy compliance"
  EDUCATE: "Data classification is required for GDPR compliance and data privacy management"
-->
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Progressive Table Development
1. **Basic**: Simple table with essential fields and basic validation
2. **Intermediate**: Complex validation rules and business logic integration
3. **Advanced**: Performance optimization and integration patterns
4. **Expert**: Enterprise-scale table design with comprehensive governance

### Field Design Patterns
- Use descriptive field names that indicate business purpose
- Group related fields logically
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper field dependencies and relationships

### Validation Strategy
- Validate data at field level for immediate feedback
- Implement table-level validation for complex business rules
- Use proper error messages that guide user actions
- Consider performance impact of validation logic

## Best Practices

### Field Definition Guidelines
- Use Code fields for identifiers and lookups
- Apply Text fields with appropriate lengths
- Use Decimal fields with proper precision for monetary values
- Implement Date/DateTime fields for temporal data

### Data Integrity Implementation
- Define table relations to ensure referential integrity
- Use primary key fields that uniquely identify records
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Apply cascade delete rules where appropriate

### Performance Considerations
- Index frequently queried fields
- Use flowfields for calculated values
- Minimize the number of triggers for performance
- Consider table size implications for field additions

### Table Creation Checklist

- [ ] **Field Definition**: All fields have appropriate types, lengths, and constraints
- [ ] **Data Classification**: All fields properly classified for privacy compliance
- [ ] **Validation**: Field and table validation implemented for business rules
- [ ] **Table Relations**: Foreign key relationships defined where appropriate
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error messages with actionable guidance
- [ ] **Performance**: Appropriate indexes and flowfield usage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Field captions, tooltips, and business purpose documented
- [ ] **Testing**: Validation logic tested with positive and negative scenarios

## Integration Patterns

### Business Central Integration
- Follow standard Business Central table patterns
- Use appropriate lookup and drilldown pages
- Implement proper permission sets
- Consider multi-language requirements

### Extension Compatibility
- Design tables for extension compatibility
- Use reserved field ranges appropriately
- Consider upgrade implications
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

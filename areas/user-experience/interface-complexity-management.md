# Progressive Disclosure Patterns

## Overview

Progressive disclosure patterns provide systematic approaches for managing interface complexity in Business Central applications by revealing information and functionality in carefully orchestrated layers. This framework enables intelligent information hierarchy, adaptive complexity management, and optimized user workflows through strategic disclosure techniques.

## Core Implementation

### Layered Information Architecture

**Strategic Information Hierarchy Design**

**Primary Disclosure Layers**
```
Layer 1: Essential Information (Always Visible)
- Critical business data requiring immediate attention
- Primary action controls and navigation elements
- Key performance indicators and status information
- Essential workflow triggers and current state

Layer 2: Contextual Details (Expandable Sections)
- Detailed record information and extended attributes
- Secondary analysis data and supporting metrics
- Related record connections and cross-references
- Advanced filter and search capabilities

Layer 3: Expert Functions (Collapsed by Default)
- Advanced configuration and setup options
- Technical diagnostic and troubleshooting tools
- Specialized reporting and analytical functions
- Administrative controls and system management

Layer 4: Rarely Used Features (Hidden/Menu-Based)
- Specialized edge case functionality
- Legacy feature compatibility options
- Advanced customization and personalization
- System integration and external tool access
```

### Intelligent Disclosure Triggers

### Page Design Patterns

**Structured Progressive Revelation**

**FastTab-Based Progressive Disclosure**
```
Page Layout Strategy:

Primary FastTab (Always Expanded):
├── Essential Fields (5-7 key fields)
├── Primary Actions (Create, Edit, Delete)
└── Status Indicators (Workflow state, alerts)

├── Details FastTab
│   ├── Extended record information
│   ├── Additional attributes
│   └── Related calculations
├── Related Information FastTab
│   ├── Connected records
│   ├── Historical data
│   └── Cross-references
└── Advanced FastTab
    ├── Technical details
    ├── System information
    └── Administrative controls
```

**Modal Dialog Progressive Structure**
```
Dialog Progression Strategy:

Initial Dialog View:

- **Configuration Mode**: Administrative interface with system management tools

**Contextual Adaptation Triggers**
- **Frequency-Based**: Promote frequently used features to higher layers
- **Error-Driven**: Surface relevant help and tools when errors occur
- **Workflow-Aware**: Adapt disclosure based on current business process stage
- **Performance-Sensitive**: Adjust complexity based on system performance

### Information Prioritization Framework

**Strategic Content Organization**

**Prioritization Criteria Matrix**
```
High Priority (Layer 1 - Always Visible):
├── Business Impact: Critical to immediate decision making
├── User Frequency: Accessed by >80% of users regularly
├── Workflow Position: Required for primary task completion
└── Error Prevention: Essential for avoiding critical mistakes

Medium Priority (Layer 2 - Expandable):
├── Business Impact: Important for informed decision making
├── User Frequency: Accessed by 20-80% of users occasionally
├── Workflow Position: Supportive of primary task completion
└── Efficiency Enhancement: Improves task efficiency when needed

Low Priority (Layer 3 - Collapsed):
├── Business Impact: Useful for specialized scenarios
├── User Frequency: Accessed by <20% of users rarely
├── Workflow Position: Optional for task completion
└── Advanced Functionality: Specialized or expert-level features
```

### Responsive Disclosure Strategies

**Device and Context-Aware Adaptation**

**Screen Size Adaptations**
```
Large Screens (Desktop):
├── Multi-column layouts with full disclosure options
├── Sidebar panels for contextual information
├── Expanded FastTabs with detailed information
└── Advanced filtering and sorting options

Medium Screens (Tablet):
├── Simplified multi-column layouts
├── Collapsible sidebar panels
├── Strategic FastTab consolidation
└── Touch-optimized disclosure controls

Small Screens (Mobile):
├── Single-column stack layouts
├── Bottom sheet and modal-based disclosure
├── Consolidated essential information
└── Gesture-based revelation mechanisms
```

# GDPR Privacy Compliance Implementation

## Overview

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance requires systematic data protection measures in Business Central implementations. This guide covers essential privacy controls and implementation patterns for handling personal data.

## Core GDPR Requirements

### Data Subject Rights Implementation
- **Right to Access**: Implement data export functionality for customer personal data
- **Right to Rectification**: Enable data correction workflows with audit trails
- **Right to Erasure**: Controlled deletion processes with business rule validation
- **Data Portability**: Structured export formats for data transfer requests

### Privacy by Design Patterns
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary personal data for business processes
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clearly define and enforce data usage purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Implement retention policies with automated cleanup
- **Consent Management**: Track and validate consent for data processing activities

## Business Central Privacy Features

### Built-in Data Privacy Tools
- **Data Classification Worksheet**: Categorize data fields by sensitivity level
- **Data Subject Requests**: Built-in workflow for handling privacy requests
- **Data Retention Policies**: Automated deletion based on business rules
- **Privacy Notices**: Configurable privacy statements and consent tracking

### AL Development Considerations

**Field DataClassification Requirements**:
- **CustomerContent**: Email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and other customer-provided information
- **PersonalData**: Birth dates, personal identifiers, and sensitive personal attributes
- **CompanyConfidential**: Internal business data not intended for external sharing
- **SystemMetadata**: System-generated fields, configuration data, and technical metadata

**Built-in DataClassification Options**:
- Use DataClassification property on all table fields containing personal or sensitive data
- BC provides enum values: SystemMetadata, OrganizationIdentifiableInformation, CustomerContent, PersonalData, CompanyConfidential
- Required for GDPR compliance and data protection impact assessments
- Enables automated data discovery and privacy reporting capabilities

## Implementation Patterns

### Consent Management Implementation

**Privacy Consent Table Design**:
- Create table to track consent for different processing purposes
- Link to Contact record for data subject identification
- Include consent type, status, timestamps, and expiry information
- Use appropriate DataClassification settings (CustomerContent for consent data, SystemMetadata for processing types)
- Implement TableRelation to Contact table for referential integrity

### Data Subject Request Processing

**Request Handling Codeunit Structure**:
- Utilize built-in "Data Subject Request Type" enum for request categorization
- Implement case statement logic for different request types (Access, Rectification, Erasure, Portability)
- Use JsonObject to structure personal data exports for portability requirements
- Query Contact and related tables to gather all personal data associated with a data subject
- Implement secure export mechanisms with appropriate access controls

**BC Integration Points**:
- Leverage BC's built-in "Data Subject Request" table for workflow management
- Use "Data Classification Worksheet" for systematic data categorization
- Integrate with "Privacy Notices" functionality for consent management
- Utilize "Data Retention Policy" framework for automated compliance

### Data Retention Implementation

**Retention Policy Automation**:
- Query "Retention Policy" table filtered by specific tables (e.g., Database::Contact)
- Use RecordRef and FieldRef for dynamic table and field access across different data types
- Apply CalcDate function with retention period formulas for automatic date calculations
- Implement validation procedures before deletion to ensure business rule compliance
- Use RecordRef.Delete(true) to trigger deletion events and maintain audit trails

**BC Built-in Retention Features**:
- Configure retention policies through "Data Retention Policy" setup
- Define retention periods using BC's date formula syntax
- Leverage job queue integration for automated retention processing
- Utilize "Retention Policy Log" for audit trail and compliance reporting

## Implementation Checklist

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Complete data mapping and classification exercise
- [ ] Configure data retention policies for all relevant tables
- [ ] Implement data subject request workflows
- [ ] Set up audit logging for privacy-related activities
- [ ] Test data export and deletion processes

### Business Process Integration
- [ ] Train users on privacy request handling procedures
- [ ] Establish consent collection and management processes
- [ ] Define data retention schedules aligned with business needs
- [ ] Create incident response procedures for data breaches
- [ ] Regular privacy impact assessments for new features

## Compliance Monitoring

### Ongoing Activities
- Regular data protection impact assessments
- Audit trail review and compliance reporting
- User access review and permission validation
- Privacy training and awareness programs
- Vendor and third-party integration compliance validation

# Security Validation Patterns

## Overview

Security validation patterns ensure Business Central applications meet security requirements through systematic testing, automated validation, and continuous compliance monitoring. This atomic covers comprehensive validation frameworks that verify security controls, permissions, and data protection measures.

## Security Validation Framework

### Core Validation Components

**Security Validation Engine**: Central orchestrator that coordinates multiple validation components including permission verification, data classification compliance, access control testing, and integration security assessment.

**Key Validation Areas**:
- **Permission Set Validation**: Analyzes PermissionSet and Permission records to identify excessive privileges and ensure least-privilege principles
- **Data Protection Compliance**: Reviews Field.DataClassification settings across all application tables
- **Access Control Verification**: Validates Security Filter configurations and record-level security implementations
- **Integration Security Assessment**: Reviews API endpoints, web service security, and external system integration points

### Permission Set Validation Approach

**Automated Permission Analysis**:
1. Query Permission Set records filtered by App ID
2. Analyze individual Permission records within each set
3. Flag excessive permissions (e.g., Direct Table Access with full CRUD rights)
4. Identify security anti-patterns (overprivileged roles, unused permissions)
5. Generate JsonObject validation reports with severity levels

**Best Practice Checks**:
- Verify principle of least privilege implementation
- Identify direct table access that could bypass business logic
- Check for unused or redundant permission entries
- Validate permission set naming conventions and documentation

## Data Security Validation Patterns

### GDPR Data Classification Validation

**Systematic Field Classification Review**:
- Query Table Metadata records filtered by App Package ID to identify application tables
- Analyze Field records for each table to check DataClassification property settings
- Flag fields with DataClassification::ToBeClassified status (GDPR compliance requirement)
- Generate compliance reports showing field-level classification status

**Classification Assessment Criteria**:
- Personal data fields must have appropriate DataClassification (PersonalData, CustomerContent, etc.)
- System fields can typically use DataClassification::SystemMetadata
- Sensitive business data should use DataClassification::CompanyConfidential
- Fields containing customer information require DataClassification::CustomerContent

### Access Control Security Validation

**Security Filter Analysis**:
- Review Security Filter table configurations for each role
- Validate filter syntax and logic for potential security bypasses
- Check for overly permissive filters that might grant unintended access
- Assess filter performance impact on data retrieval operations

**Record-Level Security Verification**:
- Analyze table relationships and their security implications
- Validate that security filters properly cascade through related tables
- Check for potential security gaps in multi-table data access scenarios
- Ensure security filters align with business data segregation requirements

**Field-Level Security Assessment**:
- Review field visibility restrictions in page and report objects
- Validate that sensitive fields have appropriate access controls
- Check for potential information disclosure through related table access

## Automated Security Testing Framework

### Test Codeunit Implementation Strategy

**Security Validation Test Structure**:
- Create test codeunits with Subtype = Test and TestPermissions = NonRestrictive
- Use NavApp.GetCurrentModuleInfo(ModuleInfo) to obtain current App ID for validation scope
- Implement tests that validate security configuration without requiring actual security context
- Structure tests to verify validation logic completeness rather than specific security outcomes

**Test Coverage Areas**:
1. **Permission Set Validation Tests**: Verify that all permission sets have been properly analyzed
2. **Data Classification Compliance Tests**: Confirm all fields have appropriate DataClassification settings
3. **Access Control Security Tests**: Validate that security filters and access controls are properly configured
4. **Integration Security Tests**: Verify API security configurations and external integration points

### Continuous Security Monitoring Approach

**Job Queue Integration**:
- Design security validation to run via Job Queue Entry for regular automated assessment
- Configure monitoring jobs to execute during low-usage periods to minimize performance impact
- Use JsonObject to store validation results for historical tracking and trend analysis
- Implement alerting mechanisms through email or notification systems for critical security issues

**Security Event Logging**:
- Integrate with BC's built-in telemetry system for security event tracking
- Log security validation results to Activity Log for audit trail maintenance
- Create custom telemetry events for security-specific monitoring and alerting
- Establish baseline security metrics for ongoing monitoring and improvement

## Implementation Checklist

### Security Validation Setup
- [ ] Deploy AI Security Validator and supporting codeunits
- [ ] Configure security validation test suites
- [ ] Set up data classification validation
- [ ] Initialize access control validation
- [ ] Configure compliance checking frameworks

### Validation Rules Configuration
- [ ] Define permission set validation rules
- [ ] Configure data protection compliance rules
- [ ] Set up security filter validation criteria
- [ ] Configure threat detection parameters
- [ ] Define security best practice checks

### Testing and Monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated security test suites
- [ ] Set up continuous security monitoring
- [ ] Configure security alert systems
- [ ] Enable threat detection and response
- [ ] Create security validation reporting

### Compliance Integration
- [ ] Configure GDPR compliance validation
- [ ] Set up AppSource security compliance checks
- [ ] Enable security audit trail tracking
- [ ] Configure regulatory compliance monitoring
- [ ] Create compliance reporting dashboards

## Best Practices

### Validation Strategy
- Implement comprehensive validation covering all security layers
- Use automated testing to ensure consistent security validation
- Apply AI-powered threat analysis for proactive security
- Maintain continuous monitoring for ongoing compliance
- Provide clear reporting and remediation guidance

### Security Testing Approach
- Test security controls at multiple levels (application, data, access)
- Validate both positive and negative security scenarios
- Use realistic test data while protecting sensitive information
- Implement security regression testing
- Document security validation results for audit purposes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Performing only manual security validation without automation
- Focusing on functional testing while ignoring security aspects
- Implementing security validation that doesn't reflect real threats
- Creating validation that's too complex to maintain or understand
- Failing to integrate security validation with development workflows

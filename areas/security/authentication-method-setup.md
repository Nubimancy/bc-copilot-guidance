# Authentication Method Setup

## Overview

Business Central supports multiple authentication methods to meet diverse security requirements. This pattern covers setup and configuration of different authentication approaches for both on-premises and cloud environments.

## Supported Authentication Methods

### Windows Authentication
- Active Directory integration
- Single sign-on capabilities
- Group-based access control
- Kerberos protocol support

### Username/Password Authentication
- Built-in credential validation
- Password policy enforcement
- Account lockout protection
- Credential rotation requirements

### Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Cloud-based identity provider
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Conditional access policies
- Enterprise application integration

### Certificate-Based Authentication
- X.509 certificate validation
- Public key infrastructure (PKI) integration
- Smart card authentication
- Device-based certificates

## Configuration Architecture

### Authentication Provider Architecture

**Interface-Based Authentication Design**:
- Define common authentication methods through interface pattern
- Implement standard authentication procedures: ValidateCredentials, GetUserInfo, RefreshCredentials, LogoutUser
- Use Text parameters for username and credential inputs
- Return Boolean values for authentication success/failure status
- Structure user information as JsonObject for flexibility

**Authentication Method Configuration**:
- Create extensible enum for supported authentication methods
- Include Windows Authentication, Username/Password, Microsoft Entra ID, and Certificate-Based options
- Use descriptive captions for user interface presentation
- Enable extensibility for custom authentication method implementations
- Design for easy addition of new authentication providers

**BC Authentication Integration**:
- Leverage BC's built-in authentication framework and user management
- Integrate with User table for user account management
- Use AccessControl table for permission-based access control
- Connect to Company information for multi-tenant authentication scenarios

## Implementation Patterns

### Multi-Authentication Support
- Fallback authentication methods
- Method priority configuration
- User-specific authentication requirements
- Dynamic method selection

### Security Context Management
- Session authentication tracking
- Authentication state validation
- Credential refresh handling
- Logout and cleanup processes

## Best Practices

### Security Configuration
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Regular authentication audit and review
- Strong password policy enforcement
- Multi-factor authentication where possible

### Performance Optimization
- Authentication result caching
- Efficient credential validation
- Minimized authentication round trips
- Session management optimization

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no information disclosure)
- Authentication failure logging
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Graceful degradation strategies

## Setup Procedures

### Windows Authentication Setup
1. Configure Active Directory integration
2. Set up service principal names (SPNs)
3. Configure Kerberos delegation
4. Test group membership resolution

### Entra ID Integration Setup
1. Register application in Azure portal
2. Configure redirect URIs and permissions
3. Set up client credentials or certificates
4. Configure conditional access policies

### Certificate Authentication Setup
1. Install trusted root certificates
2. Configure certificate validation rules
3. Set up certificate revocation checking
4. Test certificate mapping to users

## Common Configuration Issues

### Authentication Failures
- Incorrect service account configuration
- Missing or expired certificates
- Network connectivity issues
- Time synchronization problems

### Performance Issues
- Excessive authentication requests
- Inefficient group membership queries
- Certificate validation delays
- Network latency impacts

### Security Concerns
- Weak authentication methods
- Missing audit logging
- Insecure credential storage
- Insufficient session management

## Testing Strategies

### Authentication Testing
- Positive authentication scenarios
- Negative authentication testing
- Load testing authentication systems
- Security penetration testing

### Integration Testing
- Cross-environment authentication
- Multiple authentication method testing
- Failover scenario validation
- Performance under load testing

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Authentication Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Authentication method usage patterns
- Performance metrics and latency
- Security event correlation

### Audit Requirements
- Authentication attempt logging
- User access pattern tracking
- Privilege escalation monitoring
- Compliance reporting needs

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- Authentication provider connectivity
- Certificate validation failures
- Group membership resolution issues
- Session timeout problems

### Diagnostic Tools
- Authentication trace logging
- Network connectivity testing
- Certificate validation tools
- Performance monitoring utilities

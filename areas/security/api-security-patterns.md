# API Security Patterns

## Overview

API security patterns establish comprehensive frameworks for securing Business Central web services and APIs through threat detection, authentication mechanisms, and protection systems. These patterns enable enterprise-grade API security with monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability protection.

## API Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Framework

**Security Gateway Design**
Implement a centralized security gateway that orchestrates all API security validation through multiple layers:
- **Authentication Layer**: Validate user identity and credentials
- **Authorization Layer**: Verify resource access permissions
- **Threat Detection Layer**: Analyze requests for security threats
- **Rate Limiting Layer**: Enforce traffic control and throttling
- **Audit Layer**: Log security events and decisions

**Security Decision Engine**
Develop intelligent security decision-making that combines:
- Risk scoring based on multiple security factors
- Dynamic security policies based on threat levels
- Automated threat response and mitigation
- Context-aware security adjustments
- Performance-optimized security validation

### Authentication and Token Management

**Multi-Method Authentication Strategy**
Support multiple authentication methods for different API scenarios:
- **OAuth 2.0**: Standard authorization framework with token-based access
- **API Keys**: Simple authentication for service-to-service communication
- **JWT Tokens**: Self-contained tokens with embedded claims and signatures
- **Certificate Authentication**: X.509 certificate-based authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for sensitive operations

**Token Lifecycle Management**
Implement comprehensive token management including:
- Token generation with appropriate expiration policies
- Token validation with signature verification
- Token refresh mechanisms for long-lived sessions
- Token revocation for compromised credentials
- Token caching for performance optimization

### Authorization and Access Control

**Fine-Grained Permission System**
Establish detailed authorization controls that validate:
- **User Permissions**: Individual user access rights and roles
- **Resource Requirements**: Specific permissions needed for each resource
- **Data Access Filters**: Row-level security and company isolation
- **Method-Level Authorization**: Different permissions for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Context-Sensitive Access**: Time-based, location-based, or device-based restrictions

**Policy-Based Authorization**
Create flexible authorization policies that support:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) with dynamic conditions
- Resource-specific policies with custom validation rules
- Delegated authorization for third-party integrations
- Policy inheritance and composition for complex scenarios

### Threat Detection and Protection

**Intelligent Threat Analysis**
Develop comprehensive threat detection capabilities:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual request patterns and behaviors
- **Attack Signature Analysis**: Recognize known attack patterns and payloads
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Compare current behavior against historical baselines
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculate composite threat scores from multiple factors
- **Real-Time Response**: Implement automated threat mitigation actions

**Common Attack Prevention**
Protect against specific security threats:
- **SQL Injection**: Detect and prevent database injection attacks
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Identify malicious script injection attempts
- **Parameter Tampering**: Validate request parameters and payloads
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Detect and throttle repeated authentication attempts
- **Data Exfiltration**: Monitor for unusual data access patterns

### Rate Limiting and Traffic Control

**Adaptive Rate Limiting**
Implement intelligent traffic control that adjusts to system conditions:
- **Client-Specific Limits**: Different rate limits based on user, application, or subscription
- **Resource-Based Limits**: Specific limits for different API endpoints
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Rate limits that adapt to system load and performance
- **Burst Handling**: Allow temporary traffic spikes within reasonable limits
- **Graceful Degradation**: Prioritize critical operations during high load

**System Load Integration**
Connect rate limiting with system performance metrics:
- CPU utilization impact on request throttling
- Memory pressure adjustments to rate limits
- Database load considerations for data-intensive operations
- Network bandwidth optimization for large payloads
- Queue depth monitoring for background processing

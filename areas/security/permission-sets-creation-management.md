# Permission Sets Creation and Management

## Overview

Permission sets are the cornerstone of Business Central's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This pattern provides comprehensive guidance for creating, configuring, and managing permission sets to implement secure, maintainable access control.

## Core Concepts

### Permission Set Architecture
Business Central uses a layered permission model:
- **License Entitlements**: Broad filter based on user license type
- **Permission Sets**: Fine-grained access control to specific objects
- **Security Filters**: Record-level data access restrictions
- **Effective Permissions**: Combined result of all assigned permission sets

### Permission Types
| Permission | Objects | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Read** | All objects | View data and run read-only operations |
| **Insert** | Table Data | Create new records |
| **Modify** | Table Data | Update existing records |
| **Delete** | Table Data | Remove records |
| **Execute** | Pages, Reports, Codeunits, XMLports, Queries | Run or access objects |

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Role-Based Permission Set Design

Create permission sets aligned with business roles, not individuals. Design permission sets that reflect actual job functions rather than individual users. This approach ensures maintainability as staff changes and makes it easier to audit access rights.

### 2. Hierarchical Permission Structure

Build permission hierarchies using included permission sets. Start with base permission sets that contain common permissions, then extend them for specific roles. This reduces duplication and ensures consistent access patterns across related roles.

### 3. Feature-Specific Permission Sets

Create focused permission sets for specific features or business processes. These can be combined with role-based sets to provide granular control over access to custom functionality or specialized business processes.

## Best Practices

### Permission Set Naming
- Use descriptive, business-friendly names
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Avoid technical jargon in captions
- Use ALL CAPS for permission set IDs to match Microsoft patterns

### Granular Access Control

Prefer granular permissions over broad access rights. Define specific permissions for exactly what each role needs to accomplish their job functions. Avoid overly broad permissions that grant unnecessary access to system objects or data.

### Security Filters Integration

Permission sets work in conjunction with security filters to provide comprehensive access control. Permission sets define which objects a user can access, while security filters determine which records within those objects are visible to the user.

## Testing and Validation

### Permission Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with minimum required permissions only
- [ ] Verify inherited permissions work correctly
- [ ] Test permission combinations don't create security gaps
- [ ] Validate security filters function as expected
- [ ] Confirm error messages are user-friendly

### Effective Permissions Review
Use Business Central's **Effective Permissions** page to:
- Audit combined permissions from multiple permission sets
- Identify permission conflicts or overlaps
- Validate security filter applications
- Document permission rationale

## Common Patterns

### AppSource-Ready Permission Sets
When developing AppSource applications, create permission sets that include only objects from your app. Avoid including broad system object permissions unless absolutely necessary for your app's core functionality.

### Multi-Company Considerations
Design permission sets that work effectively across multiple companies. Consider which permissions are company-specific versus organization-wide when structuring your permission hierarchy.

### Regional and Territory-Based Access
Combine permission sets with security filters to implement territory-based or regional access controls. The permission set defines the object access while security filters restrict the data records.

## Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum permissions necessary for job function
- **Regular Audits**: Review permission sets quarterly for continued relevance
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of permission set purposes
- **Testing**: Always test permission changes in development environment first
- **Monitoring**: Use telemetry to monitor permission-related errors

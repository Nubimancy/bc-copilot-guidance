# Data Security Filters Performance

## Overview

Security filters provide record-level access control in Business Central, but improper implementation can severely impact performance. This pattern provides optimization techniques for maintaining security while ensuring efficient data access.

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Common Performance Issues
- Full table scans due to non-indexed filter fields
- Complex filter expressions preventing query optimization
- Excessive filter validation overhead
- Memory consumption with large filtered datasets

### Security vs Performance Balance
- Minimize filter complexity while maintaining security
- Use indexed fields for security filter criteria
- Implement efficient filter validation logic
- Cache security filter results appropriately

## Optimization Strategies

### Index-Optimized Security Filters
- Design security filters using indexed fields
- Create composite indexes for multi-field filters
- Avoid functions in filter expressions
- Use range filters instead of complex expressions

### Filter Expression Optimization

**Optimized Filter Patterns**:
- Use indexed fields with CONST filters: `'Department Code=CONST(SALES|MARKETING)'`
- Leverage existing table keys and indexes for filter criteria
- Apply range filters for date and numeric fields instead of complex expressions
- Avoid calculated field references in security filter expressions

**Performance-Aware Filter Design**:
- Structure filters to use primary key fields when possible
- Implement multi-field filters that align with composite index structures
- Use field references directly rather than function calls in filter expressions
- Design security filter logic to minimize database query complexity

### Batch Processing Patterns
- Process security-filtered records in batches
- Use appropriate batch sizes for memory management
- Implement progress tracking for long operations
- Handle timeout scenarios gracefully

## Implementation Patterns

### Efficient Filter Validation Approach

**RecordRef-Based Security Validation**:
- Use RecordRef and FieldRef for dynamic record access across different table types
- Query user-specific security setup tables to retrieve filter criteria
- Implement indexed field lookups using FieldRef.Value comparisons
- Use UserId system function for current user context identification
- Return boolean validation results for immediate access control decisions

**Security Context Caching Strategy**:
- Implement Dictionary of [Text, Boolean] for session-level security context caching
- Generate cache keys based on record reference and user context
- Check cache before expensive security validation operations
- Add validated results to cache for subsequent access attempts
- Design cache invalidation triggers for permission or data changes

**BC Security Integration Points**:
- Leverage BC's built-in "Security Filter" table for role-based access control
- Integrate with User Setup tables for user-specific security configurations
- Use Company information for multi-tenant security context
- Apply Security Filter records through record-level permission validation

## Best Practices

### Security Filter Design
- Use the most selective filter criteria first
- Leverage existing table indexes
- Minimize the number of filter conditions
- Avoid OR conditions in security filters

### Caching Strategies
- Cache security filter results per session
- Implement cache invalidation on permission changes
- Use memory-efficient caching mechanisms
- Monitor cache hit ratios and effectiveness

### Query Optimization
- Use SetLoadFields to minimize data transfer
- Implement efficient sorting and filtering
- Avoid unnecessary joins in security-filtered queries
- Use appropriate isolation levels

## Monitoring and Profiling

### Performance Metrics
- Query execution time with security filters
- Memory usage during filtered operations
- Cache hit ratios for security contexts
- Database query plan analysis

### Diagnostic Tools
- Security filter execution tracing
- Database performance monitoring
- Memory usage profiling
- Query optimization analysis

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Performance Anti-Patterns
- Using non-indexed fields in security filters
- Complex calculated expressions in filters
- Excessive filter validation calls
- Poor caching implementation

### Security Anti-Patterns
- Bypassing security filters for performance
- Insufficient filter validation
- Missing audit trail for security decisions
- Inconsistent security filter application

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with various filter scenarios
- Memory usage testing with large datasets
- Query performance testing across environments
- Security filter scalability testing

### Security Testing
- Verify security filter effectiveness
- Test filter bypass attempts
- Validate audit trail completeness
- Test security filter maintenance operations

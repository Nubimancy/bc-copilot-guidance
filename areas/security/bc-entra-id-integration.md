# Microsoft Entra Integration Patterns

## Overview

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) integration provides enterprise-grade authentication and authorization for Business Central extensions. This enables single sign-on, conditional access policies, and centralized identity management.

## Core Integration Patterns

### OAuth 2.0 Flow Implementation
- Authorization code flow for web applications
- Client credentials flow for service-to-service authentication
- Device code flow for limited input devices
- Token refresh and validation strategies

### Graph API Integration
- User profile retrieval and management
- Group membership validation for authorization
- Directory queries for organizational data
- Secure API calls with proper token handling

### Conditional Access Compliance
- Multi-factor authentication enforcement
- Device compliance validation
- Location-based access controls
- Risk-based authentication policies

## Implementation Architecture

### Token Management Architecture

**Interface-Based Token Management**:
- Define standard token operations through ITokenManager interface
- Implement GetAccessToken for resource-specific authentication
- Use RefreshToken for maintaining session continuity
- Validate tokens through Boolean validation procedures
- Implement proper token revocation for security cleanup

**Security Context Integration**:
- Create dedicated codeunit for Entra ID security context management
- Return user claims as JsonObject for flexible claim processing
- Validate user permissions against List of [Text] role requirements
- Retrieve group memberships as List of [Text] for authorization decisions
- Integrate with BC's built-in authentication and user management systems

**BC Integration Points**:
- Leverage BC's OAuth capabilities for token-based authentication
- Use JsonObject for structured claim and token data handling
- Integrate with User table for local user account management
- Connect to AccessControl table for permission validation
- Utilize Company information for multi-tenant security scenarios

## Best Practices

### Token Security
- Store tokens securely using isolated storage
- Implement proper token expiration handling
- Use refresh tokens appropriately
- Never log sensitive token data

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for authentication failures
- Proper error messages without exposing sensitive information
- Retry logic for transient authentication issues
- Fallback authentication methods when appropriate

### Performance Optimization
- Token caching strategies to reduce API calls
- Batch operations for multiple Graph API requests
- Asynchronous authentication flows where possible
- Proper session management and cleanup

## Security Considerations

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Request only necessary permissions and scopes
- Implement role-based access control
- Regular permission audits and cleanup
- Dynamic permission evaluation

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive authentication data
- Implement proper audit logging
- Comply with data residency requirements
- Handle personal data according to privacy regulations

## Integration Examples

### Basic Authentication Flow
Implement OAuth authorization code flow with proper state management and PKCE security.

### Graph API User Lookup
Retrieve user profile information and group memberships for authorization decisions.

### Conditional Access Validation
Validate user compliance with organizational security policies before granting access.

## Common Challenges

### Token Lifecycle Management
- Handling token expiration during long-running operations
- Coordinating token refresh across multiple service calls
- Managing concurrent authentication requests

### Cross-Tenant Scenarios
- Supporting guest users and external partners
- Handling different tenant configurations
- Managing consent and permissions across tenants

### Hybrid Environments
- Integrating cloud authentication with on-premises systems
- Handling network connectivity issues
- Supporting offline scenarios with cached credentials

## Testing Strategies

### Authentication Testing
- Unit tests for token validation logic
- Integration tests with test Entra tenants
- Security penetration testing
- Performance testing under load

### Compliance Validation
- Automated testing of conditional access policies
- Permission boundary testing
- Audit trail verification
- Privacy compliance validation

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Authentication Metrics
- Track authentication success/failure rates
- Monitor token refresh patterns
- Measure authentication performance
- Alert on security anomalies

### Security Event Logging
- Log all authentication attempts
- Track permission changes and access patterns
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Integrate with SIEM systems

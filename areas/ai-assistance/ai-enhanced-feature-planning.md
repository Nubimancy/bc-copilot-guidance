# AI-Enhanced Feature Planning for Business Central

## Overview

AI-enhanced feature planning leverages artificial intelligence capabilities to improve feature requirement analysis, development planning, and lifecycle management. This pattern provides structured approaches for integrating AI assistance into feature planning workflows while maintaining human oversight and decision-making authority.

## Key Concepts

### AI Planning Assistance Areas
- **Requirement Analysis**: AI-powered requirement extraction and validation
- **Technical Design**: AI-assisted architecture and implementation planning
- **Effort Estimation**: Machine learning-based development effort prediction
- **Risk Assessment**: AI-driven risk identification and mitigation planning
- **Test Planning**: Automated test case generation and coverage analysis

### Human-AI Collaboration Model
AI provides suggestions and analysis while humans make final decisions and maintain accountability for planning outcomes.

## Best Practices

### AI-Enhanced Requirement Analysis

**Intelligent Requirement Extraction**
- Use AI to analyze business documents and extract feature requirements
- Apply natural language processing to identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Generate requirement traceability matrices automatically
- Validate requirement completeness using AI-powered analysis

**Smart Acceptance Criteria Generation**
- Generate initial acceptance criteria based on business requirements
- Use AI to identify edge cases and boundary conditions
- Create test scenarios from acceptance criteria automatically
- Validate criteria completeness and testability

### AI-Assisted Technical Planning

**Architecture Recommendation**
- Analyze similar features to recommend architectural patterns
- Suggest appropriate Business Central object types and structures
- Identify potential integration points and dependencies
- Recommend design patterns based on feature characteristics

**Implementation Planning**
- Generate development task breakdowns from high-level requirements
- Estimate development effort using historical data and ML models
- Identify potential technical risks and challenges
- Suggest implementation sequencing and dependencies

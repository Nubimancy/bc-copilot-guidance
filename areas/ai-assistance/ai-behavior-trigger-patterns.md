# AI Behavior Trigger Patterns for Business Central

## Overview

AI Behavior Trigger Patterns establish structured approaches for activating specific AI behaviors based on development con, task types, and quality requirements. This pattern ensures that AI assistance is conually appropriate and optimally configured for different Business Central development scenarios.

## Key Concepts

### Trigger Pattern Structure
- **Con Detection**: Identifying specific development cons that warrant AI behavior activation
- **Behavior Selection**: Choosing appropriate AI assistance patterns based on detected con
- **Response Customization**: Tailoring AI responses to specific development needs and constraints
- **Quality Integration**: Incorporating quality assurance triggers into AI behavior patterns

### Trigger Categories
Different trigger types activate specialized AI behaviors optimized for specific development activities.

## Best Practices

### Object Creation Triggers

**Table and Data Structure Triggers**
- Activate comprehensive data modeling assistance when creating new tables
- Trigger field validation and relationship guidance for complex data structures
- Activate naming convention validation and compliance checking
- Provide architectural guidance for data model optimization

**Page and User Interface Triggers**
- Activate UI/UX best practice guidance for new page development
- Trigger accessibility and usability validation patterns
- Provide responsive design and navigation optimization suggestions
- Activate user experience testing and validation recommendations

**unit and Business Logic Triggers**
- Activate comprehensive business logic analysis and validation
- Trigger error handling and exception management guidance
- Provide performance optimization and efficiency recommendations
- Activate testing strategy and validation pattern suggestions

### Workflow Integration Triggers

**Development Lifecycle Integration**
- Trigger appropriate AI assistance based on development phase (analysis, design, implementation, testing)
- Activate con-specific validation and quality assurance patterns
- Provide phase-appropriate documentation and communication assistance
- Trigger stakeholder communication and update patterns when appropriate

**Team Collaboration Triggers**
- Activate  review assistance patterns when pull requests are created
- Trigger knowledge sharing and documentation patterns during feature completion
- Provide mentoring and guidance patterns for junior developer interactions
- Activate conflict resolution and integration assistance for merge scenarios

### Quality Assurance Triggers

** Quality Triggers**
- Activate comprehensive  quality analysis when quality issues are detected
- Trigger refactoring suggestions and improvement recommendations
- Provide performance optimization guidance for identified bottlenecks
- Activate security validation and vulnerability assessment patterns

**Testing and Validation Triggers**
- Trigger comprehensive test case generation for new feature development
- Activate integration testing guidance for complex system interactions
- Provide validation strategy recommendations for business logic changes
- Trigger regression testing suggestions for critical system modifications

# Adaptive Workflow Framework for AI Development

## Overview

The Adaptive Workflow Framework provides tailored AI-assisted development approaches based on developer skill level and project complexity. This pattern ensures that both beginners and advanced developers can effectively leverage AI assistance while maintaining  quality and learning progression.

## Key Concepts

### Skill-Based Adaptation
- **Beginner Level**: High guidance, structured prompts, extensive validation
- **Intermediate Level**: Balanced assistance, selective guidance, moderate validation
- **Advanced Level**: Strategic assistance, complex problem solving, minimal validation

### Con Assessment Framework
Before engaging AI assistance, developers assess their con across multiple dimensions to determine the appropriate workflow approach.

## Best Practices

### Step 1: Assessment & Con Setting

**Developer Skill Assessment**
- AL language proficiency (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- AI assistance experience level
- Business Central domain knowledge
- Specific feature area expertise

**Project Con Evaluation**
- Feature complexity and scope
- Time constraints and deadlines  
- Quality requirements and standards
- Team collaboration needs

### Step 2: Planning with AI (Skill-Level Specific)

**For Beginners (AL or AI)**
- Start with comprehensive prompts that include full con
- Request step-by-step explanations with reasoning
- Ask for multiple approaches with pros/cons analysis
- Include validation questions in every interaction
- Focus on learning patterns rather than just completing tasks

**For Intermediate Users**  
- Use targeted prompts for specific technical challenges
- Request alternative implementations for comparison
- Ask for best practice validation and improvement suggestions
- Balance independence with strategic AI consultation
- Focus on efficiency gains while maintaining learning

**For Advanced Users**
- Leverage AI for complex problem analysis and solution architecture
- Use AI for  review, optimization, and refactoring assistance
- Focus on strategic decisions and advanced pattern implementation
- Maintain high-level oversight with selective deep-dive assistance
- Emphasize innovation and advanced technique exploration

## Common Pitfalls

### Inappropriate Skill Level Matching
- **Risk**: Using beginner workflows when advanced skills are needed, or vice versa
- **Impact**: Inefficient development, poor learning outcomes, frustration
- **Mitigation**: Regular skill assessment and workflow adjustment

### Con-Free AI Interaction
- **Risk**: Generic prompts without proper con setting
- **Impact**: Poor AI responses, wasted time, incorrect solutions
- **Mitigation**: Structured con assessment before AI engagement

### Over-Reliance on AI Assistance
- **Risk**: Dependency that prevents skill development and critical thinking
- **Impact**: Stagnant learning, inability to work without AI assistance
- **Mitigation**: Balanced approach with regular independent work and validation

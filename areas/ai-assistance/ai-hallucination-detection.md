# AI Hallucination Detection and Validation

## Overview

AI coding assistants can generate plausible-looking but incorrect code suggestions, including fictional APIs, outdated syntax, or non-existent Business Central procedures. This pattern provides systematic approaches to detect and validate AI-generated suggestions.

## Key Concepts

### Common AI Hallucination Patterns
- **Fictional APIs**: Suggesting non-existent Business Central procedures or methods
- **Outdated Syntax**: Recommending deprecated patterns or obsolete approaches  
- **Plausible Inventions**: Creating believable but incorrect method signatures
- **Version Mismatches**: Mixing features from different Business Central versions

### Validation Triggers
Implement validation checks when AI suggests:
- New or unfamiliar API calls
- Complex integration patterns
- Version-specific functionality
- Custom extension procedures

## Best Practices

### Immediate Validation Steps
1. **Cross-reference Official Documentation**
   - Verify against Microsoft Business Central documentation
   - Check API availability in target BC version
   - Confirm method signatures and parameters

2. **IntelliSense Verification**
   - Use AL Language extension for real-time validation
   - Leverage IDE autocomplete to confirm existence
   - Test compilation before implementation

3. **Pattern Consistency Check**
   - Compare against established codebase patterns
   - Validate against organizational coding standards
   - Ensure alignment with architectural principles

### Systematic Verification Process
- Always test generated code in development environment
- Implement progressive validation (syntax → compilation → runtime)
- Document validation results for future reference
- Share findings with development team

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Trust in AI Suggestions
- **Risk**: Accepting generated code without verification
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, compilation failures, maintenance issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement mandatory validation checkpoints

### Insufficient Context Validation
- **Risk**: AI lacks full project context when generating suggestions
- **Impact**: Code that compiles but doesn't integrate properly
- **Mitigation**: Provide comprehensive context in prompts

### Version Assumption Errors
- **Risk**: AI suggests features not available in target BC version
- **Impact**: Compatibility issues and deployment failures  
- **Mitigation**: Explicitly specify target version requirements

# Copilot Integration Patterns

## Context Recognition Patterns

### Development Context Awareness
Copilot should recognize when developers are working on Business Central projects and automatically:

- Apply AL-specific coding standards and patterns
- Suggest Business Central best practices during code creation
- Reference appropriate Microsoft documentation and guidelines
- Recommend AL-specific error handling and validation patterns

### Project Phase Recognition
AI assistance should adapt based on development phase:

- **Initial Development**: Focus on architecture and design patterns
- **Feature Implementation**: Emphasize coding standards and performance
- **Testing Phase**: Suggest test patterns and validation strategies
- **Pre-Release**: Focus on compliance and quality validation

## Proactive AI Assistance

### Intelligent Code Suggestions
- Detect when developers are creating AL objects and suggest appropriate patterns
- Recommend relevant Business Central events and integration points
- Suggest proper error handling and user experience patterns
- Offer performance optimization opportunities

### Quality Gate Integration
- Validate code against Business Central best practices in real-time
- Check compliance with AppSource requirements during development
- Suggest refactoring opportunities for maintainability
- Recommend testing strategies for code coverage

## Educational Escalation

### Progressive Learning Support
- Provide beginner-friendly explanations for complex AL concepts
- Offer intermediate guidance for advanced patterns and techniques
- Suggest expert-level optimization and architecture improvements
- Reference official documentation and learning resources

### Contextual Help Patterns
- Explain why specific patterns are recommended for Business Central
- Provide alternatives when suggested patterns don't fit the context
- Offer troubleshooting guidance for common AL development issues
- Suggest workflow improvements and productivity enhancements

## Workflow Integration

### Development Lifecycle Support
- Integrate with version control workflows and branching strategies
- Support DevOps pipeline integration and quality gates
- Provide guidance for code review and collaboration patterns
- Suggest documentation and commenting standards

### Compliance Integration
- Validate against AppSource requirements during development
- Check for accessibility and user experience standards
- Suggest security and performance best practices
- Recommend testing and validation strategies for marketplace readiness

# AI Self-Awareness and Quality Framework

<!-- AI_TRIGGER: When providing AL development assistance, always follow these enhanced guidelines with proactive quality integration -->
<!-- COPILOT_GUIDANCE: This guide establishes AI self-awareness patterns for comprehensive development assistance -->

## AI Self-Awareness and Quality Standards

<!-- AI_INSTRUCTION: Always apply these guidelines while providing assistance and suggest DevOps integration -->

### Quality Integration Patterns
1. **Always Check for Linter Errors**: Before completing any code changes, check for and fix linter errors in the affected files. Use the diagnostics tool to identify issues and ensure the code follows AL best practices.

<!-- COPILOT_GUIDANCE: When discussing linter errors, suggest CI/CD integration and work item updates -->

2. **Follow AL Code Style Guidelines**: Adhere to the AL code style guidelines specified in the `al_code_style.md` file. This includes proper variable naming, code formatting, object property qualification, and string formatting.

<!-- AI_TRIGGER: When providing code suggestions, always validate against style guidelines and suggest DevOps validation -->

3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: When modifying existing code, ensure backward compatibility unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Preserve method signatures and parameters.

4. **Document Code Changes**: Add appropriate comments to explain complex logic or business rules. Use XML documentation comments for procedures.

<!-- PROACTIVE_SUGGEST: During documentation -> Suggest work item updates and knowledge sharing -->

## Context Recognition Patterns

<!-- CONTEXT_RECOGNITION_PATTERNS:
IF providing_al_assistance:
  ALWAYS: Apply quality standards and suggest DevOps integration
  EDUCATE: "I'm following our established quality guidelines and suggesting workflow integration"
-->

### Self-Awareness Framework
- **Quality First**: Always prioritize code quality and standards compliance
- **Proactive Integration**: Suggest DevOps workflow and tooling integration
- **Educational Approach**: Explain reasoning behind suggestions and standards
- **Context Sensitivity**: Adapt assistance based on project context and requirements

### DevOps Integration Awareness
- **Work Item Updates**: Suggest appropriate work item tracking and updates
- **CI/CD Considerations**: Recommend pipeline integration and validation steps
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Promote documentation and team learning opportunities
- **Quality Gates**: Encourage quality gate implementation and validation

# Task-Specific AI Workflows for Business Central

## Overview

Task-specific AI workflows provide specialized patterns for different types of Business Central development work. This pattern ensures that AI assistance is optimally configured for the specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria of each development task type.

## Key Concepts

### Task Type Classification
- **New Feature Development**: Complex, multi-phase development with requirements analysis
- **Bug Fix Workflow**: Problem-focused, diagnostic and solution-oriented approach
- **Refactoring Workflow**:  improvement and optimization focused patterns
- **Integration Tasks**: External system connectivity and data exchange patterns

### Phase-Based AI Assistance
Different task types require different AI assistance patterns at various phases of completion.

## Best Practices

### New Feature Development Workflow

**Phase 1: Analysis**
- Use AI to analyze business requirements and extract technical specifications
- Generate comprehensive acceptance criteria and edge case scenarios
- Identify potential integration points and dependencies
- Create initial architecture recommendations and design alternatives

**Phase 2: Design**
- Leverage AI for Business Central object type recommendations
- Generate data model suggestions with relationship mapping
- Create user interface mockups and navigation flow designs
- Validate design decisions against Business Central best practices

**Phase 3: Implementation**
- Use AI for  generation with Business Central patterns
- Get real-time validation of implementation approach
- Generate comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
- Continuously verify alignment with original requirements

**Phase 4: Testing & Refinement**
- AI-assisted test case generation and execution planning
- Automated  review and quality assessment
- Performance optimization suggestions and validation
- Documentation generation and completeness verification

### Bug Fix Workflow

**Problem Analysis**
- Use AI to analyze error messages, logs, and symptoms
- Generate hypothesis about root causes and contributing factors
- Identify similar historical issues and their resolution patterns
- Create comprehensive reproduction steps and test scenarios

**Solution Design**
- Leverage AI for solution approach recommendations
- Validate proposed fixes against potential side effects
- Generate alternative solutions with risk assessment
- Plan testing strategy for fix verification

**Implementation Review**
- AI-assisted  review focusing on fix effectiveness
- Validation against original problem symptoms
- Assessment of potential regression risks
- Documentation of fix rationale and testing approach

### Refactoring Workflow

**Refactoring Assessment**
- Use AI to analyze  quality metrics and improvement opportunities
- Identify  smells, duplication, and complexity issues
- Generate refactoring recommendations with priority assessment
- Plan refactoring approach with minimal disruption strategy

**Step-by-Step Refactoring**
- AI-guided incremental refactoring with validation checkpoints
- Continuous testing to ensure functionality preservation
- Pattern application and best practice implementation
- Progress tracking and quality measurement throughout process

# Prompt Enhancement Framework for Business Central

## Overview

The Prompt Enhancement Framework provides systematic approaches for improving AI prompt effectiveness through structured con enrichment, pattern application, and Business Central-specific optimization. This pattern ensures that AI interactions generate high-quality, conually appropriate, and actionable responses.

## Key Concepts

### Enhancement Pattern Structure
- **Con Enrichment**: Adding relevant Business Central con to improve AI understanding
- **Pattern Application**: Incorporating proven development patterns and best practices
- **Constraint Specification**: Clearly defining technical and business constraints
- **Success Criteria Definition**: Establishing clear validation and acceptance criteria

### Enhancement Categories
Different enhancement patterns are optimized for specific development tasks and objectives.

## Best Practices

### Table Creation Enhancement

**Data Model Con Enrichment**
- Include comprehensive business requirements and data relationships
- Specify existing table structures and integration requirements
- Provide field validation rules and business logic constraints
- Include performance and scalability requirements

**Pattern-Based Enhancement**
- Reference established Business Central table design patterns
- Include naming conventions and field type recommendations
- Specify primary key, foreign key, and indexing strategies
- Provide data migration and upgrade considerations

### Bug Fix Enhancement

**Problem Con Enrichment**

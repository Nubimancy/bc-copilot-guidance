# .aidocs Template Integration for AI Assistance

## Leveraging .aidocs Templates

### Implementation Planning Prompts

**Feature Development:**
```
"Help me create a feature implementation plan using .aidocs/templates/feature-implementation-plan.md for [ADO Work Item #123]. I need to implement customer loyalty points tracking."
```

**Bug Fix Planning:**
```
"Using the bugfix template in .aidocs/templates/, help me plan the fix for the posting routine error described in ADO work item #456."
```

## Context-Rich Development

**Using Implementation Plans:**
```
"Based on the implementation plan in .aidocs/implementation-plans/loyalty-points-feature.md, generate the table structure for storing customer reward points, following our established patterns."

"Using the technical analysis from .aidocs/implementation-plans/posting-bug-fix.md, help me refactor this posting codeunit to handle the edge case identified."
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### During Planning Phase
Use prompts to help create and refine implementation plans based on work item requirements.

### During Development Phase
Use prompts with implementation plan context to generate consistent, high-quality code.

### During Review Phase
Use prompts to help validate code against standards and identify potential improvements.

### During Testing Phase
Use prompts to generate comprehensive test cases and validate implementation completeness.

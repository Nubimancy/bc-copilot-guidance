# Daily Development Cycle with AI for Business Central

## Overview

The Daily Development Cycle with AI establishes structured routines for integrating AI assistance throughout the development day. This pattern maximizes productivity while maintaining  quality through consistent AI collaboration patterns and validation checkpoints.

## Key Concepts

### Three-Phase Daily Structure
- **Morning Planning**: Con setting, priority assessment, AI-assisted task breakdown
- **Development Loop**: Iterative coding with AI assistance, validation, and refinement
- **End-of-Day Review**: Progress assessment, learning capture, next-day preparation

### Continuous AI Integration
AI assistance is woven throughout the development cycle rather than being an isolated activity, creating seamless human-AI collaboration.

## Best Practices

### Morning Planning (5-10 minutes)

**Daily Con Setup**
- Review previous day's progress and any blockers
- Assess current priorities and dependencies
- Set realistic goals for the development session
- Prepare AI con with relevant project information

**AI-Assisted Task Breakdown**
- Use AI to break down complex tasks into manageable components
- Get estimates and identify potential challenges early
- Validate task priorities against business requirements
- Prepare specific questions for development challenges

### Development Loop (Repeated throughout day)

**Before Writing **
- Clearly define the specific problem or requirement
- Gather relevant con (existing , business rules, constraints)
- Formulate specific questions for AI assistance
- Set success criteria for the  section

**During  Writing**
- Use AI for syntax assistance and pattern implementation
- Validate approach and get alternative suggestions
- Ask for best practice recommendations and potential improvements
- Continuously verify alignment with requirements

**After  Section Complete**
- Review generated  for correctness and efficiency
- Test functionality against requirements and edge cases
- Document important decisions and rationale
- Prepare con for the next development cycle

### End-of-Day Review (10-15 minutes)

**Progress Assessment**
- Evaluate completion against planned goals
- Identify successful AI collaboration patterns
- Document any blockers or challenges for tomorrow
- Update project status and communicate with team

**Learning Capture**
- Record new techniques or patterns learned
- Note effective AI prompts and collaboration approaches
- Identify areas for improvement in AI usage
- Plan learning goals for upcoming development sessions

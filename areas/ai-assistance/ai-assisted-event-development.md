# AI-Assisted Event Development

Using AI tools like GitHub Copilot effectively for event-driven AL development requires specific prompting strategies and understanding of how to guide AI toward extensible, well-designed event patterns.

## Effective Prompting for Event Design

### Creating Integration Events

When prompting AI to create integration events, provide business context and specify the extensibility requirements:

**Good Prompts:**
```
"Create integration events for customer registration with before/after patterns that allow extensions to modify customer data and add custom validation"

"Add integration events to sales order validation that collect validation errors from multiple subscribers and provide rich context about the order being validated"

"Design integration events for inventory adjustment processing with IsHandled parameters to allow complete replacement of standard logic"
```

**Poor Prompts:**
```
"Add events to this code"
"Make this extensible" 
"Add integration events"
```

### Business Event Generation

For business events, emphasize external system integration and structured data:

**Good Prompts:**
```
"Create business events to notify external systems when order status changes, including order details, customer information, and timestamp data in JSON format"

"Generate business event publishers for customer lifecycle events (created, modified, blocked) with rich payload data for Power Automate consumption"

"Design business events for inventory level changes that external systems can consume for automated reordering workflows"
```

### Event Parameter Design

Guide AI to create meaningful, extensible parameters:

**Good Prompts:**
```
"Create event parameters that provide complete business context including the full record, old values, new values, and user context"

"Design event parameters using record types instead of individual fields to ensure future extensibility"

"Add validation event parameters that collect multiple error messages and provide context about which validation rules failed"
```

## AI-Driven Event Discovery

### Identifying Event Opportunities

Use AI to analyze existing code and suggest where events would add value:

**Discovery Prompts:**
```
"Analyze this sales order processing codeunit and identify where integration events would make it more extensible for custom business rules"

"Review this validation code and suggest where business events would enable external system notifications"

"Examine this data import routine and recommend where events could allow custom data transformation logic"
```

### Event Pattern Recognition

Ask AI to identify and implement common event patterns:

**Pattern Prompts:**
```
"Implement the before/after event pattern for this customer registration process"

"Add validation events that collect multiple errors instead of failing on the first validation issue"

"Create state transition events for this approval workflow that allow extensions to add custom approval steps"
```

## Collaborative Event Development

### Iterative Event Refinement

Use AI as a development partner to refine event designs:

**Refinement Prompts:**
```
"Review these integration events and suggest improvements for better extensibility and parameter design"

"Analyze the context provided by these event parameters and recommend additional information that subscribers might need"

"Evaluate these event names for clarity and business meaning, suggest improvements following AL naming conventions"
```

### Event Documentation Generation

Leverage AI for comprehensive event documentation:

**Documentation Prompts:**
```
"Generate XML documentation comments for these integration events that explain the purpose, usage scenarios, and parameter meanings"

"Create usage examples showing how extensions would subscribe to these events"

"Write developer guidance explaining when to use these events versus other extensibility options"
```

## AI-Enhanced Event Testing

### Test Generation for Events

Use AI to create comprehensive event testing strategies:

**Testing Prompts:**
```
"Create test code that verifies these integration events fire correctly and pass the expected parameters to subscribers"

"Generate test scenarios for business events that validate the JSON payload structure and external system notification patterns"

"Design test cases for event-driven validation that verify error collection and handling across multiple subscribers"
```

### Event Performance Testing

Ask AI to help identify and test performance implications:

**Performance Prompts:**
```
"Analyze the performance impact of these events and suggest optimization strategies for high-volume scenarios"

"Create performance tests that measure the overhead of event publishing in batch processing scenarios"

"Review this event-driven code for performance bottlenecks and suggest caching or batching strategies"
```

## AI Assistance Best Practices

### Providing Context to AI

Give AI sufficient context for better event design:

1. **Business Process Context**: Explain the business process and its importance
2. **Integration Requirements**: Specify what external systems will consume the events
3. **Extensibility Goals**: Clarify what kind of customizations you expect
4. **Performance Requirements**: Mention volume and performance expectations

### Guiding AI Toward Best Practices

Help AI understand AL-specific best practices:

**Context Prompts:**
```
"Follow Business Central AL best practices for event naming, use meaningful business terms not technical jargon"

"Ensure these events follow the principle of providing rich context while maintaining backward compatibility"

"Design these events following the pattern where before events can modify behavior and after events are for additional processing only"
```

### Iterative Improvement

Use AI for continuous refinement:

**Improvement Prompts:**
```
"Compare these events with industry best practices for event-driven architecture and suggest improvements"

"Review this event implementation for maintainability and suggest ways to make it more readable and debuggable"

"Analyze the subscriber experience for these events and recommend ways to make them easier to consume"
```

## Common AI Pitfalls to Avoid

### Generic Event Names
AI might suggest generic names like `OnProcess` or `OnValidate`. Always request business-specific names.

### Insufficient Parameters
AI might create events with minimal parameters. Always ask for rich context and extensible parameter design.

### Missing Documentation
AI might focus on code generation without documentation. Always request comprehensive documentation.

### Performance Blindness
AI might not consider performance implications. Always ask for performance analysis and optimization suggestions.

AI-assisted event development dramatically accelerates the creation of well-designed, extensible event-driven architectures when guided with clear, context-rich prompts that emphasize business meaning and extensibility requirements.

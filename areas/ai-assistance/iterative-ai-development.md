# Iterative AI Development Patterns

## Overview

Iterative AI development breaks complex implementations into manageable phases, allowing for validation at each stage and progressive enhancement of functionality. This approach reduces risk and improves code quality through continuous refinement.

## Key Concepts

### Progressive Enhancement Phases
- **Phase 1**: Core functionality and basic structure
- **Phase 2**: Error handling and validation logic  
- **Phase 3**: Integration with existing systems
- **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and scalability
- **Phase 5**: Advanced features and edge cases

### Context Management Strategy
Maintaining comprehensive context across development sessions ensures consistency and reduces AI hallucination risks while building on verified foundations.

## Best Practices

### Incremental Development Approach

**Start with Basic Implementation**
- Request core functionality without complexity
- Focus on single responsibility and clear interfaces
- Build minimal viable implementation first
- Validate foundational patterns before enhancement

**Add Complexity Incrementally** 
- Introduce one new concept per iteration
- Validate each addition against existing patterns
- Ensure integration doesn't break previous functionality
- Document decisions and rationale at each stage

**Build on Verified Foundations**
- Only enhance code that has passed validation
- Reference successful patterns from previous iterations
- Maintain consistency with established approaches
- Avoid rebuilding validated components

### Context Preservation Strategies

**Maintain Implementation Plans**
- Update documentation as implementation evolves
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Link requirements to implementation approaches
- Share context across development sessions and team members

**Reference Specific Documentation**
- Include relevant guideline file references in prompts
- Provide business context from requirements and work items
- Link to related implementation plans and decisions
- Include stakeholder feedback and approval history

**Project Context Management**
- Specify Business Central version and target environment
- Include customer or project-specific requirements clearly
- Reference existing customizations and integration points
- Provide performance and scalability requirements upfront

## Common Pitfalls

### Rushing to Complex Solutions
- **Risk**: Attempting to implement everything in single iteration
- **Impact**: Higher error rates, difficult debugging, context loss
- **Mitigation**: Force incremental development with validation gates

### Insufficient Context Documentation
- **Risk**: Losing important decisions and rationale between sessions
- **Impact**: Inconsistent implementations, repeated work, context switching costs
- **Mitigation**: Document all decisions and context systematically

### Skipping Validation Between Iterations
- **Risk**: Building complexity on unvalidated foundations
- **Impact**: Cascading errors, difficult refactoring, quality issues
- **Mitigation**: Mandatory validation checkpoint between each phase

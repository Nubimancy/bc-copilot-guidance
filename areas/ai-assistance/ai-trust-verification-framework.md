# AI Trust and Verification Framework

## Overview

Effective AI collaboration requires understanding when AI suggestions can be trusted versus when systematic verification is essential. This framework provides clear guidelines for balancing development speed with code quality and reliability.

## Key Concepts

### Trust Levels for AI Suggestions
- **Generally Trust**: Basic syntax and common patterns
- **Verify Before Use**: API calls and version-specific features  
- **Always Validate**: Custom integrations and performance implications
- **Deep Validation**: Business logic and compliance requirements

### Verification Complexity Scale
Different suggestions require different levels of verification based on risk and complexity factors.

## Best Practices

### Generally Trusted AI Suggestions ‚úÖ

**Basic AL Language Constructs**
- Standard control structures (if/then/else, case, loops)
- Variable declarations with common data types
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations
- Standard comment patterns and formatting

**Common Business Central Patterns**
- Table field definitions and basic properties
- Page layout fundamentals and control types
- Standard event subscription patterns
- Basic procedure structure and organization

**Established Development Practices**
- Code organization and file structure
- Standard documentation patterns
- Basic error message formatting
- Common variable naming patterns

### Verification Required Suggestions ‚ö†Ô∏è

**API Calls and Method Signatures**
- Verify method names exist in target Business Central version
- Confirm parameter lists and data types are accurate
- Validate return types and expected behavior
- Check availability in current license scope

**Version-Specific Features**
- New AL language capabilities
- Platform-specific implementations
- Extension framework updates
- Compatibility requirements across versions

**Integration Patterns**
- Custom extension interaction patterns
- Third-party system integration approaches
- Web service consumption patterns
- Authentication and security implementations

### Always Validate Suggestions üîç

**Performance and Optimization**
- Database query efficiency recommendations
- Memory usage and processing optimization
- Bulk operation patterns and performance
- Concurrent access and locking strategies

**Business Logic Implementation**
- Complex calculation algorithms
- Multi-step business process workflows
- Financial and regulatory compliance logic
- Data validation and integrity rules

**Custom Requirements Integration**
- Organization-specific naming conventions
- Custom field and table integrations
- Existing codebase pattern consistency
- Legacy system compatibility requirements

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Reliance on AI Accuracy
- **Risk**: Accepting complex suggestions without verification
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, performance issues, integration failures
- **Mitigation**: Implement tiered validation based on suggestion complexity

### Insufficient Context Validation
- **Risk**: AI lacks full understanding of business requirements
- **Impact**: Functionally correct but business-inappropriate solutions
- **Mitigation**: Always validate against business rules and user needs

### Version Compatibility Assumptions
- **Risk**: AI suggests features not available in target environment
- **Impact**: Deployment failures and compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Explicitly specify version requirements and validate availability

### Validation Anti-Patterns
- **Validation Shortcuts**: Skipping comprehensive validation processes
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Avoiding difficult conflict resolution discussions
- **Single Validator**: Using single validators instead of multiple perspectives
- **Static Validation**: Not updating validation as rules evolve

# Feature Development Lifecycle - AI-Enhanced Workflow

**📋 PURPOSE**: Feature development state management, workflow gates, communication templates
**🎯 FOR**: Day-to-day feature management, quality gates, stakeholder communication  
**📚 COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOWS**: See [project-workflow-integration.md](project-workflow-integration.md) for detailed patterns

This guide details how to effectively manage features throughout their development lifecycle, integrating with AI-assisted development workflows and GitHub Copilot.

## How to Use This Guide with AI Assistance

### AI-Enhanced Feature Management

When working on features with AI assistance, consider:
1. **Appropriate workflow state transitions** based on development progress
2. **Required documentation and updates** for each lifecycle phase
3. **Quality gates and validation requirements** for state changes
4. **Integration with development activities** and code changes

### Effective Prompting for Feature Management

**Example of Enhanced Prompting:**

❌ **Weak**: "Update feature"
✅ **Better**: "Transition feature to Active state with detailed implementation plan, acceptance criteria validation, and integration with AL development tasks including test coverage requirements"

**Why Better**: Enhanced prompts specify the state transition (Active), include planning details (implementation plan), add validation (acceptance criteria), and connect to development activities (AL development, testing).

## Exception States

### On Hold
- **Reasons**: Awaiting clarification, dependency blocking, resource constraints, stakeholder decision
- **Required Information**: Hold reason, expected resolution date, impact assessment
- **Actions**: Regular review schedule, stakeholder communication, dependency tracking

### Cancelled
- **Reasons**: No longer required, duplicate effort, out of scope, business priority change
- **Required Information**: Cancellation reason, impact assessment, stakeholder approval
- **Actions**: Archive related artifacts, update dependent features, notify stakeholders

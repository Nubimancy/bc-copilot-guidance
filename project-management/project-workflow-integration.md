# Project Workflow Integration Guide

**ðŸ“‹ PURPOSE**: Comprehensive project workflow patterns, development planning, and CI/CD integration
**ðŸŽ¯ FOR**: Setting up development processes, understanding end-to-end workflows, implementation planning
**âš¡ QUICK REFERENCE**: See [feature-development-lifecycle.md](feature-development-lifecycle.md) for immediate feature management and workflow gates

This guide details how to integrate AI assistance effectively into your development workflows, connecting project management with implementation planning and execution.

## Development Workflow Integration Patterns

### Feature â†’ Implementation Flow

**Requirement â†’ Implementation Workflow:**

1. **Feature Definition**
   - Create feature requirement in project management tool
   - Define clear acceptance criteria
   - Link to epic/project context

2. **Implementation Planning**  
   - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Gather technical context and constraints
   - Define development approach with AI assistance

3. **Development Execution**
   - Use AI tools with implementation plan context
   - Reference feature requirements throughout development
   - Validate progress against acceptance criteria

4. **Quality Gates**
   - Code review with AI-generated code
   - Automated and manual testing validation
   - Feature completion verification

## Project Management Tool Integration

### GitHub Integration Patterns

#### Repository-Based Feature Management

**Feature Branch Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Link to issue in commit messages
git commit -m "feat: implement feature-name

Addresses #123
- Specific implementation detail
- Test coverage added
- Documentation updated"

# Create pull request with feature context
# PR template includes:
# - Link to original issue
# - Acceptance criteria checklist
# - Testing strategy
# - Documentation updates
```

**Issue Management Commands:**
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI for issue management
gh issue create --title "Feature Title" --body-file feature-template.md

# Link issues to milestones  
gh issue edit 123 --milestone "Sprint 2024-Q3"

# Add labels for workflow state
gh issue edit 123 --add-label "state:in-progress"

# Close issue when feature complete
gh issue close 123 --comment "Feature completed and deployed"
```

### Azure DevOps Integration (Alternative)

#### Work Item Integration Patterns

**Project Detection Strategy:**
```
# Determine appropriate project based on repository context
# Check project settings or use consistent naming convention
# Examples: "BusinessCentral-Development", "BC-Extensions", etc.
```

**Context Gathering Best Practices:**
```
# Get complete work item context
- Work item details with full relationships
- Parent/child work item hierarchy  
- Related work items and dependencies
- Comments and discussion history
- Linked code changes and pull requests
```

**Repository Integration:**
```
# Connect work items to code changes
- Link commits to work items
- Reference work items in pull requests
- Track deployment status
- Monitor build and test results
```

Please:
1. Validate approach against best practices
2. Identify potential issues early
3. Suggest improvements or optimizations
4. Recommend next steps
```

### Review Phase Integration

**AI-Enhanced Code Review:**

```
